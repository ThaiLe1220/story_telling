He may be funny but tragically, he's also an asshole. My name is Anthony Stafford. My book Chasing the Dragon (40,543) is a young adult-semi-autobiographical-coming-of-age story about a boy named Paul. This is the fictionalized story of my life. It is read from the intentionally pretentious and pessimistic viewpoint of Paul. The story slips in and out of first and third person as Paul makes his way through the life of a disappointed-common man. He writes a journal in a rundown motel explaining exactly how he ended up with no money, company, or catharsis. He recalls his few lovers, the struggles of alcoholism, child abuse, poor writing, and the ever elusive answer for happiness."

Once upon a time there was an enchanting little girl with a pink bow in her blond locks born with a silver spoon in her mouth, whose future was lying open before her, a broad sunny highway to happiness. Then all broke down, neither by hers nor by anybody else\u2019s fault but by shere \"historical necessity\", as ideologists call it.\nThe girl understands that to stay afloat she has not only to fight for it but also to agree to some compromising. Her main problem will be how far she can go without going too far; how many values she has to foreclose and still stay whole.\nThe Drowning of a Goldfish is a story of a girl who succeeds to hold firm in turbulent times, of a girl that \"can keep her head when all about her are losing theirs and blaming it on her\".\nThe Drowning of a Goldfish is the story of a survival that has its price.\n(The quote above is modified from the poem \u201cIF\u201d by Rudyard Kipling)"

Gethsemane is a place of great suffering, so called because of the agony and suffering that Jesus had experienced in the garden of Gethsemane before being betrayed by Judas. In this story, the Drus' inner city row house is a kind of Gethsemane for Jasmine Dru because her life there is so difficult. And although Paige is the woman pictured on the cover of the book and at times endures more than her fair share of suffering during the story, Jasmine Dru is the actual scion of Gethsemane to which the title refers. (The cover image is only a detail of the complete sketch, which includes both Jasmine and Paige with the trunk of an olive tree between them.) And the question to be answered throughout the story is a simple one: Will Jasmine live long enough to escape her own personal Gethsemane, or will she be destined to live in that hell forever? Or, worse yet, will she succumb to the evil found there just as Jesus had so long ago?"

So it\u2019s pretty damn cold. Rain bounces off of the brim of his cowboy hat as he sits, not moving a muscle. He\u2019s in deep thought about what he\u2019s going to do next. He knows that all of the towns north of his position have already been heavily looted and ransacked. He\u2019s also aware that the area in which he is currently a guest is known for having raider groups. He needs food, though. He can feel the pit in his stomach growing larger and larger as each hour passes. He can go maybe one more full day without food."

            "summary": "From prosperity to poverty, the Collegiate to the reform ship Akbar, the docks to delinquency, to Hull and back...Jobe the Beginning is a must for anyone with an interest in Victorian history. In late 19th century Liverpool, the hills of Everton look down on the River Mersey and the thriving port that brings so much wealth to the city. But the confusion of black roofed tenements, courts and slums that stretch as far as the eye can see reveal that amongst the gilded prosperity there lies a neglect of any pursuit beyond the merest means of existence.\nEight-year-old Jobe, born on the sloping hills is oblivious to the struggle of life in the slums where, Kitty, his Catholic mother was born or the opulence of the rolling pastures of the Wirral where his Protestant father, Albert, grew up. His parents, ostracised from their respective families because of their sectarian splitting love, live only for each other and their son. It is not until an unforeseen circumstance imposes the disease of desperation and deprivation onto their lives that they become aware of the poverty, industrial unrest and sectarian storms that are blowing through the city."

Altruistic social worker, Ethan Harper, passionately combats the physical abuse, neglect, and exploitation of children for Child and Family Services in Citrus County, California. Strictly adhering to the laws and practices necessary to do his job, he still holds himself responsible when a child in one of his cases is murdered. Ethan's moral compass becomes further distorted when he accidentally kills an abusive father in self-defense. Cleared of any wrongdoing in both the company's and law's eyes, he begins to struggle with feelings of both guilt and appreciation. Gradually, with each new case, he pushes the boundaries of acceptable behavior to prevent the loss of another child. When Ethan's own daughter is nearly abducted by a deranged pedophile, he dispenses his own violent justice to ensure the safety of other children. His actions inadvertently attract the attention of Chase, an FBI Special Task Force agent, and Roger, a serial child molester. While hiding the truth from Chase to avoid going to jail and losing his beloved career, Ethan's family becomes a target as Roger pursues a personal vendetta against him."

It was one of the many things that I loved about her and one of the many things I hated. For years every night, I would beg for her to let the princess live and let the dragon die but she never listened. I'm glad she didn't, she was preparing me. Preparing me for this moment because you see though the seven dwarves and flying boys didn't exist in the real world there was one thing that each story got right, one thing that wasn't just a tale... the monsters. They were everywhere even when you couldn't see them, you felt them. The feeling of someone staring you down, the chills on the back of your neck, those weren't coincidences or cold gusts of wind. Those were us."

It is not the same as social anxiety disorder. Instead of fearing social situations, people with anthropophobia specifically fear people. Anthropophobia may cause physical symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat, sweating or nausea. \n\nAgoraphobia is a fear of being in situations where escape might be difficult or that help wouldn't be available if things go wrong.

The day to day struggles of living in poverty but living life happy. The sacrifices you make for those you love. The author describes the growing into adulthood and learning the ways of the world. How mean and unsafe this world actually is. He writes of experiencing the first time love, knowing true love. How fun and exciting it can be.\n\nThen in just an instance, your whole life can change. Everything you thought would be is no more. The story shows how the power of money can rule anything and how evil it can be.

Her head felt heavy, possibly a hangover from drinking.

She decides to begin her journey with an inspirational thought, completely out of the blue, to become a long distance runner.

No one wants to talk about depression, but it's comfortable to realize you are not alone.  It's even better when the person you are reading about is even worse off than yourself, and that it's okay to laugh about it.  I wrote the book, and I still laugh out loud over some of the scenes.  I still get hot over the sex scenes as well.

Entertaining and informative, there's no other like it. Darren Campbell is a neurosurgeon who seemingly has it all: a beautiful family, a lucrative practice in an idyllic Colorado mountain town. Yet he becomes overwhelmed from being inundated by drug seeking patients and the administrative frustrations of modern medicine. When he falls into a coma under circumstances suspicious for drug abuse, his mind becomes a window for reliving a series of historical vignettes, the stories of his vaunted physician ancestors. From the glory of ancient Greece during the time of Hippocrates, to the black forests of a medieval German monastery; from the romance of restoration Paris to the gritty streets of industrial Baltimore, and the horror of the brutal Italian campaign during WWII; the tales of Darren's ancestors become a veritable travelogue of medical history. Once he awakens, he needs a miraculous rejuvenation to weather the stresses that led to his downfall. How he finds it is a parable which serves as both an indictment and a celebration of modern healthcare, a revelation both for doctors themselves, and for anyone who's always wanted to know: What is my doctor really thinking?"

The book is about an African community untouched by colonization that is now battling to play catch up with other surrounding communities in terms of civilization development that was laid by the colonialists.  The book explores various challenges faced by African countries in trying to proceed further from the foundation laid by the colonial masters and the donor community. The problems range from brain drain, lack of leadership skills or rather absence of systems that promote the ascendency to leadership positions of only those individuals with proven leadership and management skills, conservative mentality that limits exploration of life itself and absence of sacrifice by current generations to set a solid stage for future generations\nThe book is centred on a youthful chief, Nicodemus Musharu, who is selected by the spirits of the land to inherit the throne after his father ahead of his elder brothers. The selection of Nicodemus ahead of his two elder brothers symbolises how leadership skills are ignored in the African leadership nominations. His elder brothers had mo"

On the journey, in London, for revenge against his father, he'll meet a lot of people who'll develop his personality. He finds himself getting caught up in a lot of twists and turns.

Ten years ago, they met randomly, an encounter that still resonates in both their lives....\n\nBefore I Leave You is a novel that considers the delicate and powerful complexities of the human heart. A central theme is the blurring of lines between attraction, and love, and sexuality, and how black and white are painfully inadequate at depicting the intricacies of love. A question raised in the novel\u2019s central themes is: How far should you go for the love you never could forget? And; can you justify walking out on your whole life to find someone unlikely to ever be found, someone you can\u2019t stop loving?\nThe story also touches upon the often-complicated relationships between mothers and daughters, and the legacies these leave. The novel is a reflection on, and a celebration of, the opposites that rule us but needn\u2019t be mutually exclusive; past and present, regret and forgiveness, black and white, man and woman, head and heart, light and darkness."

Knowing this full well themselves, the band's members sign a contract to never disband until, or unless, one of them dies. As the twentieth century draws to a close, talented but troubled songwriter, Eugene McElhenny, returns to his hometown of Fairview, Pennsylvania, after years of failure in New York. A chance encounter unites him not only with three supremely talented musicians, but also with a fiery young woman. A band and a romance surge meteorically, but there are those with agendas that do not necessarily coincide with those of the band, or the couple. Despite the obstacles, the band, realizing that what they have is something truly unique, decide to sign a contract among themselves, stipulating that they are never to break up until, or unless, one of the members is deceased."

He's made centuries at Lords, scored goals at Wembley, received Nobel prizes for literature and science while fronting seminal rock trios of the 1960's; not bad for someone who had been in the remedial classes at school.\nBlessed with an unflappable temperament and a cast-iron belief in his intellectual superiority, the mess of his physical life seems to be more of a problem for his friends and relatives than it is for himself.\nWith this in mind, he begins to write a comic novel in which he consults a psychotherapist to examine this 'ailment' before realising that there's nothing to stop him from turning his fictitious consultations into real ones."

Hurt and confused, Jamie decides he must travel to the place where Matt was killed. He must go to Kabul. \n\nOnce there, he visits the base where Matt was stationed, talks to soldiers, walks routes he imagines Matt took, asks kids in the street about a soldier who might have given them sweets, or had a kick about with them. In the evenings he gets drunk in his hotel. There he befriends Amir, a trained lawyer working as a receptionist. \u201cNo law, no need for lawyers,\u201d laments Amir. They talk about London, where Amir was \u201cstationed\u201d while studying. Peckham, argues the twice-mugged thrice-burgled Amir, is only a little less dangerous than Kabul. One day, in a market square, Jamie is attacked and only the intervention of a woman, a translator called Asifa, saves him. After several more chance meetings, they become friends.\n\nThe novel concludes in London, with Jamie having taken charge of Asifa\u2019s youngest brother, whom he begins to see as his own."

Gary Sapling is a gifted young musician who works in a mall in (fictitious) Panville California.  He is invited to spend a week with his uncle Karl in a remote part of the state, and that begins a fateful journey.  Gary and Karl make an impulsive drive to San Francisco, for what was meant to be a brief stay.  However, when Gary has a chance meeting with a member of the guerilla theatre troupe the 'Frisco Freedom Collective, Gary goes to one of their live shows.  That results in a quick and deep bonding with the troupe, who live in a communal apartment in the city.  Gary ends up moving in with them, and enters a loose love triangle with two of the young female members.  As the summer progresses, Gary ends up showcasing his talent in a short 'indie' film, booking a paying gig at a local club, getting a recording contract, and finding true love in a way that he wasn't expecting.  This work is mostly influenced by \"Hair\", \"Almost Famous\", \"Boogie Nights\", and the countercultural writings of the late 60s and early 70s.  It's meant for mature, open-minded readers.  "

A national tour as an opening act for a veteran band does not go as planned, and is almost immediately followed by a World Tour that brings the band much more than it had planned to receive, both for better and for worse. Along the way the members of \"The 4F Family\" do their best to juggle their personal lives with the surreal, which is slowly becoming reality, and a young fan inspires them to new heights as people. Still lurking in the shadows is the omnipresent and enigmatic \"benefactor,\" an individual who seems hell bent on destroying 4F, and, specifically, its songwriter, Eugene McElhenny.

It doesn\u2019t tell a narratively put story, but tells the story of thoughts. It offers a depiction of cruising through the hectic mind of a teenage girl. However, these chains are universal. No one lives in a bell jar, commotion is always in there. There is always a sort of abuse, a sort of confusion, a degree of unbearable feelings. We all experience these, despite the lack of observation in their direction. It\u2019s nearly impossible to figure it all out without looking for awakening, but writing this helped me find myself.

Two buildings collapsed, the entire world affected. Every day, more than 140,000 people die around the globe. Of that number, about 30,000 are young children, less than 5 years old. You & I know we're all connected. Still, many don't realize regular 9/11 incidents happening daily.\n\nDownfall addresses our pain. The pain of trying to understand senseless killings. Life is the way you see it. Evil exists, regardless. Every innocent victim of 9/11 was a loved one. A loved one, ripped away from his/her family. This story grieves with the families.\n\nThousands of children die every day, from starvation. They die because of extreme poverty. Something that can be totally avoided. It isn't. This work of fiction highlights child mortality. Terrorists are heartless. We're not rogues. We care for each other, like we are personally affected. Maybe you are.

He works at a nursing home, where so many once-rising suns do settle and set. The Nursing Home is a novella about a tragedy that occurs in a small American town. Rob, a middle-aged man who works as an assistant at a nursing home, serves as the main character of the story. A variety of vantage points is offered, and the narrative is not linear, but skips around; this, in the author's opinion, in no way hampers readability. Phrases like \"dark humor\" and \"character studies\" might well describe what this little book has to offer, in terms of practical value. In sum, the work is amateurish. This is the natural consequence of its being the author's first book. For the most part, plot is sacrificed for a wide assortment of character sketches, and yet the work as a whole still functions as a complete story (or so the author supposes). Probably, the work might be classified as postmodern, even though it does not cross into the territory of meta-fiction. As for the matter of a central theme, that must be left to the judgment of the individual reader. However, the writer's hope is that the work will serve as a useful reflection on the subject of aging."

But today, as she must continue working, she asks him to visit her the following day in nearby Mitla.

Thus begins a synaptic pas de deux through Ethan's memory palace: Ari\u00e1dina from Oaxaca and Ariadne from Prague, an art student he fell in love with in Paris. It was 1968, August, and the Prague Spring of that year was about to be crushed by Soviet tanks. It was exactly as her father had predicted, and the reason he forced her to seek exile in Paris. Now, with no communication with her father in Prague, she was determined to go home. After bidding Ethan farewell high in the belfry of Venice's Campanile di San Marco, she descended alone.

Living on the south coast and squarely in the sights of Nazi guns, 15-year-old Henry Bradley becomes one of literally millions of school-aged children loaded onto trains and sent away from home to apparent safety, one school at a time.

Neither Henry nor his friends want to go, but when Winston Churchill said, \"We shall fight on the beaches,\" the Prime Minister wasn't using rhetoric so much as referencing a real and immediate probability. Henry learns a great deal about war, family, loyalty, Spitfire pilots, farming, pain, grief, relationships, and - ultimately - himself. In 1990, Henry returns from America to talk with writer Elizabeth Crenshaw, and she is quickly captivated by his story.

It expresses that limit between the familiar versus the unknown and dangerous. It is an uncertain threshold between hope and fear - between the domestic and the wild.\n\nDuring an otherwise ordinary evening at her home in the Jericho district of Oxford, that hour brushed past Martha and she realised something completely new about instinct. Present were her husband and her research supervisor, meeting for the first time. By the end of the evening the lives of all three will have changed forever. Martha and Lloyd's marriage will have hurtled through its inevitable tipping point and Aldo's gift for audacious confrontation, magnified by his penchant for tenure-strength marijuana will have positioned him in their lives as more than a purely academic supervisor.

(Reviewed for Foreward Clarion by Aimee Jodoin, November 8, 2017) Gene Scott\u2019s coming of age novel, Jellybeaners, follows the lives of two radically different high school seniors who just happen to be competitors in motocross. Reading their journals is a sheer delight, especially that of Sam, who is wickedly smart, funny and, at times, frighteningly perceptive. But I wouldn\u2019t give Bo\u2019s journal short shrift as his upbringing has been far different than Sam\u2019s. A major theme running through this novel is the growing opioid addiction in the US, particularly in the Southeast.\n\nThrough his characters, Scott charts the growth of the illicit trade conducted by so-called Pain Management Centers and the bureaucratic corruption found at all levels of government; a combination which has resulted in a sharply rising number of opioid addicts and deaths from opioid abuse. Jellybeaners is a fascinating read. I loved following Sam and Jasper as they ride along mountain roadways and plan their futures, and learning about the natural beauty found in the book\u2019s setting. Jellybeaners is most highly recommended.\n\nJack Magnus, Readers' Favorites"

After her mother dies, riddled with disease in a medical daze just shy of her hundredth birthday, Kate and her husband come to the conclusion that they don't want to die that way.

As she finds out, her intentions are irrelevant, because the shoebox has an agenda of its own.\n\nLike the urge to touch a hot stove, she throws caution to the wind when a gut feeling tells her to open the notes. Doing so rehashes monumental loves that have entered and exited her life. In a hypnotic state she is mentally transported to significant scenes, reliving them as if they are in real time and reciting the dialogue aloud. \n\nAt 15, Olivia loses her first love, her father, in a homestead coal fire. Depression sinks its claws into her mother but Olivia still has to manage to mature alone. At 28 she finds herself pregnant but desperate to flee the relationship. She pursues a \u201ctherapeutic abortion\u201d during a period when it\u2019s illegal. Finally, at 32 the revelation of the beauty of life comes like the candle fire that flickers around her while dancing the zapateado at a Quincaenera."

Why? Because just like her face that's how she made them feel. She was Heaven. Ironically, no one has ever made her feel that way, not until she met this handsome and well-respected musician. He made her feel important, but she knows there is always an exchange. However, she still fell for his charms and gentleness even though she knew she shouldn't. She doesn't deserve him nor does he deserve someone like her. In fact, she is the wrong person to fall for. It would be a huge mistake for a person to fall for her. Why? Because unlike what people call her, her life is nowhere close to being Heaven."

Chrissie has seen a name twice before and in each case the person named was dead within 24 hours. The name Chrissie sees this time is \u201cTrinny Grisham,\u201d a 13-year-old who lives with her abusive father, the Barker. Trinny and her siblings have tried several times to run away from home and failed. But Trinny has a new escape plan that she and her brother Cleve are going to carry out that very night.\nThe novel takes place in Bowness, a town on the outskirts of Calgary, in 1950, within a 24-hour time period. It is told through the perspective of many people: Cora Latticer who cannot get her mind off Eddie Candleford and longs desperately for children of her own; Chess, father of Chrissie, who redirects his day to spend it with his daughter and goad her out of her inward-turning complacency; Trinny\u2019s 8-year-old sister Jaicey, who has revealed the secret escape plan in an English assignment she plans to read aloud in class; Myrna, a nurse at the Baker TB Sanatorium, who owns a car that Cleve and Trinny plan to steal; Chummy, an orphan at Woods Christian Home; Jilly, whose mother is dying at the San. A major theme of the book is how children, in spite of the negative forces that assail them, cope with their lives and their situations.  \n"

His soul met with the southern \u201cShahryar\u201d, who marries every few months. That\u2019s why this story was written.\nI tried to uncover the psychological and social aspects through deep discussions about the philosophy of life and religious discussions dealing with faith, atheism, and the philosophical view of religion. At sometimes, it was necessary to uncover many of the \"taboos\" that control Arab society and drag it into the darkness of ignorance and racism that we denounce when it comes from others and denies our affliction with this dreaded social disease.

Review\nLowlife is a collection of sixteen funny, edgy short stories from Mike Botur that can be taken as a \u2018tip of the hat\u2019 to the strugglers and \u2018losers\u2019 of our society. That is not to say that these people are homeless or \u2018down and out\u2019, but rather the choices made by most of the characters would not cut it at any \u2018respectable\u2019, politically-correct middle-class family\u2019s dining table. That is partly why this book is such a tasty, refreshing read. It\u2019s as if Mr Botur hung out at CBD fast-food outlets after midnight \u2013 swilling bad coffee on a hard-plastic seat, listening to conversations, and jotting observational notes under the garish yellow lighting. It could be that this is the best environment for reading Lowlife, too. There is a ring of authenticity about these stories \u2013 both in the language used by the characters and in the physical descriptions of their environments. It is interesting to speculate as to which stories might spring from Botur\u2019s own experience. His plots \u2013 cause and effect, rapid-fire \u2018shaggy-dog\u2019, or \u2018wtf?\u2019 \u2013 are well-crafted and his characters convincing. Botur is not so much a moralist, as an informer \u2013 without ever becoming a show-off."

Despite his success he realizes he has lost his essential integrity and remembers the meaningfulness of a time when he and his family had integrity, when he marched with his father, a Catholic deacon, in the march Martin Luther King organized in Cicero in 1966."
