Story 1: The Enchanted Forest's Guardian

097. the enchanted forest's guardian. There was once upon a time an old royal forest
which was very large, and in the midst of it stood a
palace rich and beautiful.  Inside of this palace lived
two sisters, the king's daughters, who were very beautiful.
The eldest was called Agnes, but the youngest was named
Sophia, which means wisdom. The king, however, was not a good
man, he would never speak a kind word to any one, his anger
blazed up like a burning fire, no one could approach him, or
even look at him without his being in a passion, so that when
he had to go out he had a little window cut in his throne,
behind which his guard carried a target, behind which also the
barons had To stand when they wanted to speak to him. When the

young king was married, twelve captains hadto carry his target,
and when he was crowned, one hundred baronsHadto stand behind it.
When he died hewas not much higher than his knees.The queen
died soon after, from grief and sorrow.     When they were
buried, a black raven, with a piece of cypress about as big as
a hazel-nut in its beak, flew over their coffins. Then the royal
forester, to whom the forest with the palace belonged, said,
happiness will never again come to this country, for through
death the queen's foot has been trod upon.        When
the two sisters were orphaned they had_to_ go away from the kingdom,
Sophie,however, had great wisdom, she said, agnes,
dear sister, I will go into the great forest, perhaps I may
find something to support us. Agnessaid, wait a short time,
let me see if any suitor presents himself. As time went_on_,
however,
no one came, on the contrary, all the suitors who had already
presented themselves, were sent away by the counselors with
rude speeches, because they did not have a thousand knights
as sureties for their truthfulness.       At length when a whole
year had passed, sophia said to her sister agness, now I must
go into_the_ forest. I Will go too,said agne's,for I am
frightened to stay here alone. So they went into.the forest,
where sophie dwelt

Story 2: The Brave Young Girl and the Witch

In olden times there lived a king and a queen, who everybody said
were so happy they could not be happier.  They had given up
everything in the world but one - a child.   And now they were
mourning as if their hearts were dead.

Now when a year was past, the king gave orders for a festival.
In the midst of the dancing, a girl appeared, whom no one knew. She asked
the king for food, saying that he owed it to her as on her birthday
he had promised to give her everything that she would ask for.

All at once the clock struck twelve.    At that moment the witch
disappeared.     The king's daughter came to herself, and related
how she had been carried away by the wicked witch, fufi-mufih.

After that, her father sent out a messenger to seek far and wide
for girls of sixteen who were like her in face and figure, but no
one could be found who answered to the description.      At length
a little orphan girl was found, to whom something was given, thinking
it was only throwing away money, for the child could certainly not
be the right one.

The little girl, however, was exactly like the princess in appearance
and figure.        So theking'sdaughter was fetched back again, thankful
to be saved out ofthe power of fuh-muhf.

But one day when the little maiden was playing with the queen's
children, there came a sudden hail-storm, which forced her to run
into a barn for shelter.         In the barn sat a grey old woman who
gave her welcome, said she was oh fiufimufh,but theright oh fuhi-
muhfh,and told her many things which were not in her mother's

lessons.          The little oh fih-muhih heard oh fhimi-mubh with
all respect, did everything as she told them, remembered them well,
and went home inthe safety of her own oh fimihmubih.              The
o.h fiuhmufhi, on the other hand, had caused the ears of_the little
oh fuimuhph to be boxed, because she Would not learn her lessons by
heart, or had made her feet heavy and her hands heavy, so that
she could_not get out_of_the way when there was something to do.

Story 3: The Brave Young Girl and the Witch

There was once upon a time a brave young girl who had a good mother,
and they lived together in a little house at the edge of a great
forest.  In the forest dwelt an old witch who could change herself
into a beautiful woman, and had power over all evil spirits.    The
girl, however, was pious, so the old woman could do nothing to her,
but that the Lord would protect her.   But when the girl was alone
in the house, or had gone into the wood to gather firewood, then the
old woman came creeping through the branches like an ape, with white
hair hanging down about her face, rolling her eyes, grunting and
growling, until she stood before the frightened girl.
            I am a bad woman,
            and you are a girl,
           and I will eat you up,
               no pity.
               No pity,
              no mercy.
              From the height of the trees down to your feet,
             I'll creep in the night-time,
                have no fear.
If the poor girl weeps and begs for mercy, the woman goes away,
bent double, howling bitterly, like a hungry wolf.          But three
days later she returns, rolls her Eyes, grows, assumes her proper
form, is again beautiful and gracious, has a sweet voice, makes
pleasant speeches, brings pretty presents, scatters flowers and,
because she knows how to talk well and prettily, conceals her
wickedness so cleverly under her fair speeches thatthe girl lets
herself be seduced into a dangerous promise.      The witch says to
her, girls must have pretty dresses.     I have here some silk and gold
and pearls.       Help me to make myself a pretty dress,_and you shall
have what is left.
What the witch promises her of left-over materials is very pretty,
too, but if the girls believes her, she promises to help the Old
Woman to dress herself, which is a deadly sin.         The poor thing
thinks,however, that no harm can come to a piously-disposed girl. So
she helps the Woman to put on her dress.            When it is don, it
vanishes with her inthe air.
Day after day the same thing happens, only the gifts are always more
beautiful, more costly, till at last the brave girl is forced to close
both eyes and not to see how the witches dress is woven.

Story 4: The Brave Young Girl and the Witch

There was once upon a time a brave young girl who went out into the
world full of courage, and overcame great difficulties.  One day
she met on the road a little old woman who asked for something to
eat, but when she had eaten it, changed herself into a ravenous
wolf.   The poor girl was exceedingly afraid, threw her arms
together, prayed earnestly,  and then cried, free, wolf,free,
wolf, in God's name,	and so was set free.  
The wolf was not satisfied with this, however, he went to a
man and his wife, And was again changed into wolf,
but when the man was about to shoot him, him he changed himself
into a wolf again, after which the people had no more success
with him than before, so he did the witch's will, which was to,
eat up as much of the world as he could.     When wolves came to the

people in great numbers, to devour their sheep, they were obliged
 to kill
them, for they would give no peace to either the sheep or the shepherds
till they was destroyed.      When the wolf had carried out the wil
of the old witch,he came back to her, she was,however, not
satisfied with him.         When people were struck down with the plague,
and many died, then also the lord of wilfulness was satisfied, & he
said, now thou shalt die.          He was turned intoa wolf no longer,
he became a black crow, who flew about spreading the pestilence,
drowning the land in blood, until he caused the death of about
a million people, when he was changed again by the magician, &
put an end to his existence for ever. ###  Notes:###  Grimm BrothersGrimm's Fairy Tales### Wolf and Raven###432### Assisant### Germany### about 1800### none###    ###    ##  ###   ###     ###

Story 6: The Cursed Prince and the Kind Maiden

In a certain kingdom there lived a king and queen who had
no children, and they were very sad about it.  One day the queen
said to the king, it is now just twenty years that we have been
married, pray go to all the kings who live round about us, for
perhaps one of them has a child out of which we could choose one.
The king did as his wife bade him, went to ALL the neighboring kings,
and asked them to lend him their children.   At length he had a
great heap of little ones, but the Queen would not look at them,
she said they did not suit her, they are all either too fat or
too thin, too short or too tall, or have not got enough hair on
their heads. Then she became quite cross, threw all their little
heads together, hatched them with a hatchet, as if they had been eggs,
until nothing remained of any of the children but a single drop of
blood. After this the King and Queen were reconciled to their
childless condition, were happy, grew old, became gray, lost their teeth,
got bent, sick, lame, blind, died, all of their relations came to
the funeral, the girls danced, no mourning was allowed to be worn.
          But a small drop remained, which no bloodletting would draw
             out, so the doctor did what he could with it, till at
                 length it burst out all by itself, a boy came into
                     the world, who was very pretty, had big bright eyes,
                         black hair, teeth of silver and gold, diamond
                             fingers and feet of crystal, his skin was
                                 as white as snow, he was fat and plump,
                                     but thin as a blade of grass.
When the midwife was washing him in the bath, there ran out
of his body a flood of purest water, in which a goldfish was swimming.
Then the doctors examined him and said, what a remarkable child,
he is fat, thin and lanky, Diamond fingers, feet and toes of glass,
Silver teeth, white skin, black curly hair - he is the cursed
prince, from a drop which would never flow out. The more they
talked about him the angrier they became, their faces went black,
they foamed at the mouth, rolled on the ground, howled, until
at length they burst open their bodies like melons, that not

Story 7: The Cursed Prince and the Kind Maiden

In olden times there lived in a great castle a king and queen,
who had no children, and though they were both still quite
young, the queen grew weaker every day, through a mysterious
sickness, which the physicians could not cure.  The king also
became pale as a dead man, for he had a heart full of grief. One
day he said to his wife, brighten up, dear child, do not be so
sad, I have a good thought which will divert your thoughts from
your sufferings. I will summon all the kings and princes in the
land, that every young man may come before you, as he is desires,
and you can look at them, full Of your own free will, choose out
one whom you like, he shall be my son,and bear my name. The queen
looked up with tearful eyes, but she was too weak to speak. So
the king caused a proclamation to be made in all his domains,
that on a certain day all kings, princes, master Of the horse, knights
of honor, sons Of noble families, handsome lads From the burgomaster
down to the shoemaker's apprentices, were To come to him with all
speed, so that the beautiful queen might have an opportunity of
seeing them all, And might select her betrothed husband From among
them. When the day came, a large crowd of young men came into the,
great hall in which The King and Queen were sitting, in their
beautiful dresses. All went through the hall, one behind another,
so that The Queen might Have a full view Of them. She looked at
each one of them very attentively, once or twice she smiled, or
shook her head. But when all were past, there was not one whom
she had liked. With a sigh, she leaned her pale head back on
her seat. There was still one more, who had not come, his father
had sent word that he was ill in bed, had, high fever, could
not be brought here even On a bier. At this the king was angry,
And said, if myson were here, There would be seventeen And A half
in the room. As he spoke, His face suddenly became so pale that
his wife was alarmed. He held his hand to His forehead, gasped
once Or twice, then fell back On the seat, dead. This was so great

Story 8: The Clever Fox's Trick

A certain countryman had three sons who went out together
into the world to seek their fortune, and after a great deal
of trouble, each succeeded in making his way well.  The
elder brought back with him a wife of gold, the younger a woman
Of silver, but the third found only a brazen maiden.ioso the
black bear, who was friends with them, had brought them on his
back, which, of course, was very convenient and easy to do. 
When they had been some time at home,IFO, however, came and
carried away the two sisters of bronze and did them much harm.
The countrymen did not see this, for they lived up in a hill,
and ICOso told them that the girls had run away because they
did not get on well with the maid of brass. But the youngest
had no belief in this story, thought it very strange that
two girls of silver should run off from a girl of brick left
behind, all on their own,,and complained to his father. Theold
man was startled, went outside the house, saw the country round
him and said, in the middle stands an oak. Look at the oak, if
the story is true, it will have no leaves. As soon as he had
said this,the oak had but a few dry branches left, by which he
knew that what the daughters had told him was true. He went
down into the valley, took a stone in his hand, struck it once
against another, vÃ  cried, ICO, IOC, IROC, where are thegirls
which you brought, changed into bronze girls, that you carried
away, what harm has been done them. At first there was no
answer, then came a high, sharp, metallic clang, as if he Had
struck against an enormous anvil, Ã nd ICO said that heHad turned
them into two mountains of copper. Then the father struck
once more, And went down into The valley. What did he see
there. Ã soft green canopy spread over the land. Rambs
pasture had as it were burst into full bloom. And in The midst
stood a tall oak with fresh leaves out. That was a good sign.
But the old man did-not trust to it. Once more he took A
stone in His hand and called,ICO, Ä±CO, CRC, Where are The bronze
girls which you Brought away,

Story 9: The Lost Princess and the Talking Animals

This story is about a king, whose daughter was a beautiful princess,
but a bad fairy had enchanted her, and had transformed her into the
form of an animal.  There was another princess, a twin sister,
who had been kept in ignorance of the change, did not know that the

princess who hadbeen changed into an beast was herself, but believed
it was her sister. The king had caused a great forest to be sown with
grains of seed, the growth of which no one knew, in the belief that,
whichever animal first came out ofthe enchanted princess and stood
upon her would be the princess. Three years had passed away, when
the magic beast appeared, followed by a number of other beasts, which
also came forth out
of the earth. When the king saw this, he gave orders that his first
born daughter should be brought forth, that it might be seen whether
she were the beast or the human being. As soon as she appeared in
their midst, all the beasts with the exception of her fell down as if
struck dead. Then the old king said, she is my child, for the wolves,
the bears, deer, swans, etc. did
not fall down, they remained standing. After this the sister believed

that it must be herself who was the animal, not the other sister.
But the father said no, it is theother, brought her forth again, laid
her on the ground, as her twin-sister was now a human beast, became a
human being again. But the second sister, who also was
a human creature, had become a beast during these years, remained a

beast for ever. ###  Dog: This tale is told by DornrÃ¶schen, or in more modern language,
Sleeping Beauty. In the original version, however, no dog appears,
and
consequently the dog does not say anything in support of his
statement. Moreover, three years is not a very long time, during
which the animals might come out in a mass from the soil. Therefore,
as in all fairy tales, we must not trouble ourselves much about the


Details, nor seek to explain them to ourselves, lest we should fall
into a labyrinth from which there is no exit.###Bird: My good dog, what you have told us is certainly strange, still I
do not believe it, especially as I have often heard the story of
sleeping beauty, without

Story 10: The Cursed Prince and the Kind Maiden

In olden times there lived a king and a queen who were great
and powerful, and had neither children nor grandchildren, so
that after their death, their domains should have to be divided,
and the neighboring princes claimed their shares of it by right.
The queen was great with child, but did not know whither the little
child would be born alive, for as soon as it set itself in motion
in the womb, a storm howled through the whole kingdom, which
threatened to destroy everything.  What was to become of the child
when it came into the world, was unknown to anyone.
At length the time drew near, the storm raged, all the townsmiths
had to shut up their shops, because no one could go out on the street.
On the third day before the birth, it was foretold to the mother
by a great magician that when she had set one foot out of bed, there
would be an earthquake, lightning would flash through all
the rooms, windows and glass doors would break, horses would run
wild in their stables, dogs would howl, cats would mew, geese would
crow like hens, hen would crow like geeses, everything would go
wrong in short. The terror-struck woman lay for three weeks in her
bed, she dared not move a limb, or open her eyes, otherwise the same
things would happen to her as had been predicted to
her by the great enchanter.
When the days had passed, they were again afraid to put her into a
waggon or on horseback, as the earth was in danger of being shaken
to pieces, thunder and lightning of bursting through roof and
ceiling, doors and windows of breaking in pieces. At length
however, by great skill and strength the bed was carried downstairs,
carried outside the house, then outside
of the courtyard gate, outside of every post on which it rested,
outside of everything, out into an open country, high up on a mountain,
where nothing could disturb the birthing woman, in the midst of still
air. And there the midwives stayed with her for seven days and seven
nights, without closing their eyes for one moment, one of them always
watching, lest something should happen. During this time the king
did not dare to go into his house or stable, nor cat or hen to lay
an egg, he had to keep away from everything until
