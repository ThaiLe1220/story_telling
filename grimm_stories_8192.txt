Story 1: The Mysterious Old Woman's Secret

There was once upon a time an old man and his wife,
who had nothing in the world but a precious riddle, which
they wished to give to a worthy man, and to no other.  Who
that is alive and knows the answer to it, to him it is not
mysterious. Old woman. Who in a wood in summer-time finds
an oven with a hare sitting therein baking, then he knows not,
in the whole wide world, how many hairs there are on the
tail of a black horse. When the young men gave the wrong
answer, they killed a chicken, put the tail of an unshorn
 sheep into the broth, placed the cooked tail in front of the hare,
and let it there bake a little while with the chicken-tail.
Who knows what belongs to the tale, knows also how the story
goes on. Then at last a man came who knew the history of
the old woman's secret, but that was not the last. After that
came a lord who said, I know the secret of your riddles. Is
it, said the old folks, you know how we have been searching
for it all days long, a young man comes, makes a spluttering
mess of it,
costs us three chickens, if the food had lasted till the end of

our days, now behold you have to go. The lord was inflamed
with rage, leapt up, fell upon his sword,and pierced himself
to the heart. Now then the king in that country wished
himself to have the riddling secret. Hag, he says, what is
truer, the one or the other, that the hen has borne sixteen
children in her life-time, or that no hen inthe whole world
has ever brought one child intothe world. Hags, says the

old woman, it depends how you count. Do you mean the children
of the nest, in which case you are right, for then there have
been sixteen, as the cock has counted them. Or do you ask
after the chickens of her whole life,then no hens in this world

have ever borne a single child, because they have never lived
so long. How does that stand, asks the King. Why, hen's
life is so short, she can no longer sit on her egg when the egg
begins to rot. Her lord, however, sees to that, He takes
a fresh egg, gives it to her to sit upon, so that she does not

see it or smell it. As soon as she sees the fresh green egg,
she gets up and will not sit again until another death occurs.

Then she waits until a shepherd dies, ruins, birds of prey,

and ditches have arisen, và the boy who has grown up on

the chicken's green Egg, has become a tall man.THEN the lord
gives her the Egg and she sits upon it as long as her heart

desires. But when she gets on it and sees it again,she will

not sit down. She waits now until the next high lord dies.

After the ruins have fallen down a second time, The birds
have flown away, And the ditch has dried up the man who on
her chicken’s green Egge has now grown old, returns home as
An old shepherd. THEN the high man gives her another egg,

she sits on that as much asshe likes, though she always sees

it. So she makes her wait untiltheold shepherd gets back his

staff, AND the younger man has returned with it And become
young again. That is the way she has it,. Then she Gets the new
egg, her chicken sits for as many years as there Are chickens
and hENS in
this world,
but she never sees a green one. If, therefore, no HEN inthis
world has ever hatched a child the KING has to Go away. He
says, hag, there is a secret in my room, on which the life of


my kingdom depends. There is one tree therein which supports
all the gardens, all the fields, every stream, lake, brook, hay
field, corn-field, forest, meadow, orchard, until it reaches
into the furthest mountain. And if that tree dies the earth
will become bare and nothing will grow any more on land and
water, bread will fail, hunger will rage until people eat each
other up. Should I therefore have my executioners go through
every field, chop the tree to pieces, let the streams and

rivers carry it away until there remains not a bit of its

branches, leaves, blossoms, fruit, roots, fibres, sap, not an

atom of dust, of air, sun, moon, stars, would there be left,

then the kingdom would have peace again and I could sleep. Does
he say that,
asks the hags. What, Says the cook, why, sir king, my young

lord has gone out into every field with his axe, chopped the


tree to bits, thrown it into a great river which flows into
The sea, where the sea meets the sky the river is dried Up,
the morsels of wood are blackened and rotting, muddied and


sinking down, whirled about by the water, carried far away,
farther and farther away from the mountain, far from every

field and garden, from lake and brooks, near and far, beyond
land and water. Has he said that to my lord the wild man,
asked the Hag. Well, wild Man, do You see anything of those

pieces of Wood. I see a piece of old bread, burnt brown, lying

in a hole. Beyond that nothing, answers the Wild Man. Did he
say that. Ask the ant, Said the HAG. Ant, asked the COOK,
do you see any of that old tree. No, answered the Ant. Said
He, does he say THAT. Questioned THE Hagh. YES, SAID SHE,
THEN MY LORD HAS GONE TO THE CAVE WHERE THE KING OF THE

ANTS LIVES, HAS LOOKED ABOUT HIM CAREFULLY, SO THAT HE DID
NOT SEE A GRAIN OF SAND, A GRASS STALK, BREAD CRUMB, BUT THE
ANTS HAD CARRIED EVERYTHING AWAY, HURRIEDLY HASTED BACK

HOME AND SAId TO the KIng, IN THE CAVES WHERE the ANts

LIVE, THERE IS NO MORE old TREE, ONLY GRAINS OF SAND, GRASSt

STALKS, CRUMBS OF B READ. THAT is THE WAY IT STANDS. IF THE


KING HAS HIS EXECUTIONERS GO THROUGH EVERY FIELD, CHOP THE TREE
TO PIECES, LET THE STREAMS AND RIVERS CARRY IT AWAYS, IF NOT
AN ATOM OF DUST, OF AIR, SUN, MOON, STARS, WOULD REMAIN LEFT,
THE KINGDOM WOULDS HAVE PEACE AGAIN, HE COULD SLEEP. My lord

went out to look for the Secret, thinks the Old WOMAN, his
legs were frozen, nearly dead of cold, by heaven, little

things can do great things, one ant can carry a hundred
times its own weight. At length he found it in his bed, His
wife had got into it with some little thing, just a grain of,
sand, an ant’s foot, some grass, crumbs of bread. WELL, WELL,
SAID THE OLD WOMANS, THE SECRET STAYS WITH US. THE LORDS GO
AWAY. BUT, THOUGH THEY WENT AWARY, OLD HILLS REMAINED,
AND THE ANTS CAME BACK AND BROUGHT AWAV THE GRAINST, GRASS,
CRUMbs OF
BREAD, AS WELL AS THE SAND GRAINF, FOOT, &C. & C. SO THE SECRETS
STAY WITH THE LAND. OLD CHURCHES STAYED, TOO, THEN THE LITTLE

THINGS WERE TAKEN AWAWAV BY THE WILD MEN, WHOSE WOMEN WORE
THE ANT’S FEET, SANDS OF GRAins, CLOTHS INTO, WHICH THE GRASSES

WRE WOVEN, BYGONES, THEY SAW THEM, HOWEVER, AGAIN IN MODERN

CLOTHING, WITH A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY, SUGAR, RUBBER, PAINT,
VARNISH, GLASS, METAL, PAPER, BRUSHES, NEEDLES, THREAD, TEXTILES,

AND INSTEAD OF CRUSHED BONES AND DRIEDED UP HEARTS THEY

BROUGHT BACK COINS, GILDER, GOLD, OIL, PEAS, CHEESE, ETC. Etc.

ETC., SO IT WAS NOT WITH OLD THINGS, MODERNS THINGs REMAIND

IN THE WORLD. ON THIS ACCOUNT THE RIDDLES STOOD, MY OLD

MAN, HIS OLD
WOMAN,
 AND THREE CHICKENS REMAIINED OLD. NOW THE GIRL, NOW

THE BOY,
 NOW THEY, ALL THREE, DIED OF OLD AGE.

Story 2: The Poor Little Boy's Adventure

A poor woman once had a little boy who was forced to go to
school barefooted.  Then said the master to him, give me your
shoe, and go into the playroom, I want to whip you.   But the boy
refused, whereupon the teacher whipped him with all his might.
The little fellow ran crying into his mother's room, gave her an
account of all that had been done,and wept bitterly.    What,
said the mother, he was to give his shoe to the fool, but he
would not do it.        Then the little one began to weep more
fiercely, so that at last the poor mother also beganto wep with
him.         Come, said she, put on my shoe, for I must go at once to 
the school-master, AND tell him that he shall no longer molest my
children.          But, dear mother.             said he, you cannot go out alone,
you have no shoes.           No matter, little son, gone I MUST, only
run you behind me as quickly as you can, AS SOON AS I GIVE YOU THE
SHOE, TAKE IT, FOR YOU WILL SOONE NEED IT.         
When the woman had given the schoolmaster a piece of her mind,
she put her shoe on his foot, set the other in her left foot as
if it had always belonged to it, tied a straw rope round his
leg, handed it over to two carriers who were there with a load,
and ordered them to run with him to a shoemaker's who lived some
distance off.            THE SHOE FITTED HIM PRECISELY.              The carriers set out with the naked and barelegged
pedagogue, who had to hop along like a crab.      The little poor boy,
however, ran so swiftly that before long he overtook them, And
when he came to them he said, do you there hurt much?  Oh, indeed
yes, ex claimed the carrier, the knave of a school-mistress has
sold us.            
The naked boy came back home, weeping and weary,和 gave an account
of allthat had occurred, Whereupon his poor
mother began To weepsobbing, comforted him,
And said,
     you weet,
      you need not weepy,
   for you have won a shoe,
        and if you are weary,
           you may take it off,
         and put it on your foot.
And when he had taken off the shoe which hehad worn from the
hospitall, because his bare feet had pained him more than his right
foot had, there stood in it a most beautiful new silk shoe. Then
the sorrow was turned into joy, they danced about, drank themselves
merrier and merrier, until the mereet had run out.     Where upon
The mere woman sent the child tothe neighbor's to borrow a can of
meer.       But merer, cried the neighbor, mer I have none.虞 I mean
beer, runs the tale.                At length the childs mother lent him a small
cup,  and he set Out with it to bring the beer.               But  as he  was  going  through  the  forest,
beer cried a flea, lend me a cup of beer,for I am thirsty.                     The poor child gave him his,because he would not like to refuse
it, BUT the flea drank it down, then went away without more words.
While the-child was returning, from behind a bush peeped out and
cried, whist, whistle whistle whisit whittle whistle, DO YOU HAVE
NO FLINT AND STEEL ABOUT YOU' With which the others, too, all
wanted to have their cigarettes lighted, So that the lad was
forced to throw intothe fire two or three bushels of straw, before
he could light their smokes. At last he saw a beautiful girl who
asked if he Would sell her his cup. Oh,
yes,
          said He, if I sold it,
             I should die,
               but, with mere sorrow,
                  I could not live.                  THE GIRL SAID, THEN TAKE TWO GROATS FOR IT,
AND WHEN HE REFUSED THAT ALSO, SHE TOOK HIM BY THE HAND, LEAD
HIM INTO A SECRET CAVE, WHERE MANY CANDLES WERE BURNING, HER FATHER
AND MOTHER SAT AT A FEAST ON GOLDEN CHAIRS. THEN SHE PUT THE CUP
BESIDE HER, DANCED JOYFULLY AND DELIGHTEDLY AWAY WITH HIM. When the,
fat and wealthy folks saw that, THEY ALSO WENT TO DANCE, SO
THAT THE FLOOR RESONATED AND SHOOK AS IF AN EARTHQUAKE HAD STRUCK
IT. WHEN THE DANCING WAS OVER, HOWEVER, THE POOR LITTLE BOY WAS
PUT TO BED IN A GOLD BED, GOLD SHOES WERED ONTO HIS FEET, A
PRINCE'S GARMENT WAS LAID OVER HIM, 和 AN OLD WOMAN WHO LOOKED AFTER
THE CHILD, WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO LET HIM GO UNTIL HE WAS A MAN,
BUT TO FEED AND CLOTHE HIM AS A PRINCES._WHEN THE OLD Woman
WANTED TO GO OUT, she was always to knock three times at the cave
door, whereby a signal Was given to THE PRINCING TO TAKE OFF HIS
CLOTHES AND HIDE THEM AWAV, OTHERWISE HE REMAINED IN THEM.                   AS TIME WOVE ON THE KING DIED,AND THE DAUGHTER
BEQUEATHED THE THRONE TO HER BROTHER.                    AT LENGTH THE YOUNG MAN BECAME A STRONG AND
HANDSOME MAN, WHEN ONE DAY HE TOOk THE KNIGHTS WHO WISHED TO SERVE
AS HIS COMRADES, OUT TO HUNT. BUT HE WOULD NOT CONSENT TO THEIR
KILLING ANY ANIMALS, RATHER HE LET THEM NOT Bring home EVEN A SINGLE
ARROW, HE ONLY WISHes TO SHOW THEM THE ANIMALS, SAid HE, WHO IN
THIS CA VE LIVE MORE FREE AND HAPPY THAN THEY DO OUTSIDE. AT
LENGTH HE SAW A BEAUTIFUL DEER, WHICH HE SHOT AND WANTED to KILL
I' T, But THE OTHER KNIGHTS FORBID IT AND SA1D, GRANTED, SIR,

FATHER. WHEREUPON HE STOPPED HIS HAND. AND WHENHE HADDEnT LONGER

Story 3: The Talking Fish and the Fisherman

There was once a fisherman who had long been without any
success, and every day only caught one fish or none at all.
One morning he had still brought home no fish, or only one small
one, wherewith to cook, when his wife said, 'I should
be indeed surprised if to
day you brought anything but one little fish'.The fish looked up
said, ‘you are right’, and at once changed the poor little fellow
into a prince. Then he said to the fishermann - Now will you have good
luck, but in order that you may know that I am no longer a little
fish,but a human being as you are yourself, take off my eye, for
when I wore it I was afish, but since I have it under my hair,
I am a
prince'.

After that he took his eye off, the prince put it
under his hair, caught
several very fine fish, put them into his net, tied the net
to his hand, took back his
eye, put It on his fish's eye-hole, looked round himself, did not
find anyone else with him in
the sea, smiled, shook his head as if he would say, no one should see
me here catching fish_, stretched out his body - which was several
versts long when he was
a prince - and dived down again. When he Had been quite underneath the
water for a long time, he again mounted tothe
surface, had once more caught several beautiful fish,
put them Into his nets, which
were now quite full,	and	dipped his	head into the water,
took his eyehole between his teeth, approached the shore, And the		fisherman
thought to himself, today he has found a school of fish.

Then he drew the nets On land, As he always did, and carried them
with his load of fuel to		the town, where he bartered his	crops
for money,	and then went	to	the weighhouse with hisnets.  To his		surprise,
and as it had never yet happened to him, his Nets weighed exactly
One hundred,seventy-mark.

When he got home,his wife was standing at her window and saw him
coming. She called out
To him, markman, markmann, have you found plenty of Fish '.

Thefish		prince		answered		from		out of	the		seawith his voice
which she knew, 'yes, indeed', and_at once Changed back again into	a
little fish. 	He looked at the markerman, took His eye between His
Fingers, And said, take out one Fish for my meal '.

Then He put His eyeto His fish's eye - hole, disappeared,and a small fish
swam out of thenet.	The fisher - man took out the small Fish, cooked
it for His dinner, AND gave Him the other fish which He barter - ed
	for money.	WHEN he next went to sea, he Always took with Him a		live
Fish for his dinner. AND in fact, as a rule, He caught the live Fish
out of his	nets, for thefish - king always gave him one. He, however,
always put the living Fish into His pocket, before He looked for one
that was bigger, so that the little Fish should not see Him and His doings
and shouldnot change Him back Again into a mere fish.

Once when He had brought His catch to shore, Put His live fish Into His Pocket, looked ROUND Him, caught a still larger one, That was almost as big as He was tall, But didnot lookROUND for live coals, nor a light, NOR did He look for oil
nor match, As He ought to have done, to kindle a fire with, So that
He could cook His dinners. Then the livings fish cried, You fool,
you will get a fine dinner for yourself, a mass of burning flames,
AND the house will be burnt down around you, with your wife and
children, Who are now standing by the fire waiting for your dinner.

THEN He ran with fear and alarm to His house, just as IT was about
	to catch fire, drove His family out Into the open air, threw
Water on the flames, extinguished them, went back to The sea again,
dove down,_and brought live coal s, lighted a Fire, COOKED His		dinner
, AND went home with It.	BUT the crows and birds of		prey had		spied
Out the burning house and The people who were running about His children
who were so beautiful that The whole world had not Their like. THEN
HE DOVE down to THE SEA WITH HIS children, WHO ALL Grew into
PRINCES,And the PRINCESS WHO WAS the oldest, MARIED theFish - King,
BUT THE YOUNGER PRINCINGDOMS ALL MADE PEACE WITH EACH OTHER,AND
LIVED IN FRIENDSHIP AND GOOD AGREEMENT EVER AFTER.

Story 4: The Magical Tree of Wishes

There was once an old man who lived in a little house in the
midst of a great virgin forest, and he had three sons, the eldest of
whom thought nothing of knocking the second son about the ears whenever he wished to, likewise the third son, if he tried to intervene.  The eldest was little better than a beggar, for he would always say, he will get nothing when father dies, that will go to the other two. The second, however, who was called Jack, had been once a soldier, but was now come back
again, as he Had got nothing, on which to keep body and soul together, except he could find some kind of work inthe neighborhood. As he was thus wandering about he came to a pond, close
by which he saw a large gray wolf crawling out of it. Three flies
were sitting on his back, whirling their legs about, playing and
jumping about. "Halo, wolf," said soldier.   The wolf looked round
and said, "Hallo, soldier," but then he added,   "If you were sitting
there, instead of standing there getting wet feet, you would be
comfortable and warm." -- -- "-- -- "What have I got to throw into
the water," thought soldier; "oh, an iron nail will do." He threw in
his iron shoe-nail, just as the wolf had wished, whereupon thewolf
swam about in it,and the flies alighted on him again, thinking it
quite warm. Soldier went into a village near it and hired himself as
a day-laborer. When he got back home the Wolf was happy to see him,
and to make a good impression on lui, went to an estate which was
sitting close by, whipped off some leaves from a tree, which had
fallen to his lot, held them out to soldier and said,
            'Here, take those, Jack.
            If you can make anything good out
            of those leaves, I'll give you
        a whole dollar.'
Soldier thought, leaves which a wolf has handled, may have witch's
oils on them, so he thanked him, And went off with them. He stood
before a fire, roasted some pieces of meat, laid the leaves on the fire
with the meat,
And waited, till they had taken all the grease off them and had left nothing but the shell. Then he went back to wolf, Who was quite angry and thought he must have some fun played off on soldier's simplicity. However, it could not be helped, He gave him the dollar.
The third brother was named Will, AND HE was just going out as a
soldier, when he heard what wolf was saying,_and_ he asked if He would
sell his dollar. Wolf answered, no,  I will not sell it for any
money in_the_world_, BUT if you Can take it away from soldier,
yours it shall be. Will thought to himself, A dollar is a dollar,
all the same, HE can not keep it against three of me, SO he
said to him "ALL RIGHT, leave your conditions till later on." The
next day soldier stood again by the fireside, Did some sewing, put thedollar on a stone, then lay down and wentto sleep. About midnight
he was waked up by a soft whistling, open the window, soldiery,
soldierry, three fairies were standing outside, WHO HAD stolen his
dolar, BUT HAd left behind them their whittlings. If He took the stone
on which the Dollar was lying, carried it slowly to
_the_ window and threw it out, THE dollar would fall down to them
Again, IF he then asked them for his whiskeys they would give him
also his Dollar back and the fairys would go away. soldier opened thewindow, did as they told him and asked the whys and wherefores.
They were a bit angry at first, But ended by giving him his money and going away.
While he Was telling this to Will,
Soldiern had got up and gone to HIS room. WILL went thither, FOUND
THE dollar, GAVE IT BACK TO WOLF, EXCHANGED IT FOR HIS OWN,
AND WENT OFF TO HIS BATTALION. JIck hired Himself out for a While,
THEN HE SAID TO HIMSELF, THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE HERE, COULD
NOT I ASK MY FATHER FOR A LITTLE PIECE OF LAND?  He went home and AS
KED FOR IT, father said "YES, OF COURSE, WHAT KIND DO YOU WANT?"
"WHATEVER THERE MAY BE LEFT OVER AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE HAS BEEN
DIVIDED UP," answered soldier.
Next day father divided up ALL HE POSSESSED, SOLDIERN GOT NOTHING.
Soldiem thought "WHY SHOULD HE NOT HAVE SOMETHING AS WELL," AND
SAID, AS LONG AS I HAVE NOT HAVEN'T GOT ANYTHING, JUST LOOK AT
WILLY, OR THE YOUNGEST, THEY HAVE NOTHING EITHER, HOWEVER, WHEN
HE WANTED TO TAKE SOMTHING AWAY FROM THEM THEY CRIED OUT,
"FATHER, FARTHER, FOR THE SAKE OF GOD, DO NOT DIVIDE US, ONLY
GIVE US WHAT YOU HAVE GIVEN US EVERY YEAR." FARMER SAITH, WELL,
JACK, YOU SHALL HAVE IT. SO JACOB went out into THE WOODS, WHERE HE
HAD PLAYED ABOUT AS A CHILD, CHOSE OUT A PIEC OF GROUND,
ABOUT THE SIZE OF A HEN'S EGG, THAT LAY IN A NEST OF BRANCHES,
TURNED IT ROUND AND ROUND, SAWS IT DOWN WITH HIS KNIFE, TOOK
IT AWay WITH HIM, PLANTED IT AGAIN, THEN PUT IT ON HIS SHOULDER
AND CARRIED IT HOME. FARTHESR SAIDE "WHAT'S THAT"? "I DON'T
KNOW," SAIDTH soldier "BUT AT ALL EVENTS I CAN'T LEAVE
THERE." THEY PUT WATER ON IT AND IT SOON BEGAN TO SPRING AND TO
SHOOT UP AND GROW. WHEN IT WAS GROWN A Little THEY CUT IT
DOWN, BAKED BREAD OUT OF IT,
 AND ATE IT WITH DELIGHT. THEN IT GREW AGAIN,
 THEY GROWE IT A THIRD TIME, MADE IT INTO A LARGE CAKE, PUT
SUGAR AND MILK ON ITH AND DIVIDEd IT OUT. IT Grew a Fourth
TIME, IT HOPED AND FLOPPED AROUND LIKE A LIVE THING, HEn
GRABBED HIS AXE, CUT
Ith DOWN AGAIN AND PUT A STICK THROUGH Ith, CARRYING IT AW
AY. IITH DIDNT GRow ANY MORE, So soldier BENT OVER IT AS IF
TO SPEAK TO ITH, WHISPERED TO ITh, SHOOK ITr BY THE STEM,
PUT Itr UP AGAINST A TREE, STOOPed DOWN AND CUT A SMALL BRANC
He put it on HIS SHOULDERS, took IT home, planted IT again,
IT Began to Grou AND to SHOOT UPH and to grow. WHeN IT WAs

Story 5: The Poor Little Boy's Adventure

There was one summer when I was quite a young girl, and went out
every morning, as soon as day-break had come, into the open country,
to a brook which flowed near my parents' house.  I had a fancy for
it, especially when the weather was warm, for then one was obliged
to get up very early if one wanted to feel the morning fresh and
cool.
I had therefore been so long in the habit of going thither, that
I often did so even after I Was married, if my strength was not too
much exhausted by my work during the day.      One morning I got
up still earlier than usual, lay down for a short while on my bed,
and fell asleep. When I awoke, the first light was already beginning
in the sky, but I did not go out to my dear stream, I lay still a
little longer, still half asleep, let my thoughts wander here and there,
felt my heart filled with a soft joy, recalled my past youth,
my pious and dearly-beloved mother, my betrothed one, who was then
still far away, only a boy in leading-strings,but with whom I now lived
as his wife, then closed my eyes and fell sleep again.
Happily, however poor little boy, didnot open your mother's eyes,
did not call out, oh,my dear child, are you sleeping so soundly,
dear child,
do you not know that death is standing by to carry you away,
oh, do not sleep, dearchild, pray to God, repent your sins,
so that he may let you live a little longer by your father's side.    
But I slept on and did
not hear it all. And when early morning had drawn near,I laid myself
down to rest onmy husband's breast, closed his eyes as well, just
As Ihad done mine, And said - healthy, good man, he does not Know that,
before daybreak,the grey maiden of death will come to fetch him away.
But he slept sound, too, so I could not wake him.
Then I dressed myself, full of regret, went forth and strayed across
the fields to the bro ok, thinking that whenI got there I might draw
myself together and weep a very little.        But no, there was my
stream, it flowed along as usual so pleasantly, green trees shadowed
It, birds sang on it, blue bubbles rose up from its depths, everything
was still the same as on former days, why,then should I be unhappy.
With a light heart, yet sadly,too, l sat down on its brink, stuck my,
feet intothe water, looked at it steadily, took a clear draught of
its pure water.         How well it tasted, - oh,
happy water that one can drink it before death.              I sat
there a long while, listened to its murmuring, watched its playfulness,
watched its flow, thought of my mother who Was no more, of the boy
who was now my husband, remembered my whole life, reflected, sighed,
sang a song, was sad, glad, joyous, anxious, became calm, thoughtful,
gay, serious, young, old, all at once, now wise, Now foolish,Now
sound in body and soul, again sick, well again, rich, poor, famous,
unknown, happy, unhappy, according tomy fancy, or as the occasion
brought it about, until the sun grew warm and drove me home to_my_.
house.           When l entered it my children were just going outto
The fields with their father. They came up to me, pale and scared,
seized my hands, cried - mother,
mother,
just now we opened your eyesand your husband"s, AND called out -
oh,
does not think of God,
repent of your sin, otherwise death
will come and take you far from us away. But you slept sosoundly.
Come with us, mother. We will all kneel down before the crucified one
and entreat him to have mercy on us and save you. Mother,
Mother,
will younot come withus.            I opened my Eyes, saw my terror-stricken
children, Became aware of where l was, how l had spent the time, what
danger l Was in, That my prayer had been heard, felt happy,
thankful, overjoyed, fell on_my_knees with them, prayed with my_children
before the cross, Then felt healthy and strong, quite sound inbody
And soul.
My husband did Not die that day, lived on a good many years with
his children, in happiness, sorrow, misery, calarity, prosperity,
in all sorts of ways, till white hair fell down from under his
hat, But he would tell you himself that on that One day he was
spared through a miracle, because his young wife had not slept in
Vain, had petitioned the Lord, Had not believed death's false call,
And that it cost him but little to acknowledge it. ###  044. The Assisstants_of_the_Fairies### 072. Snow-White ### Assisten t: There are three sorts Of fairies, one kind brings good luck,
the other bad,  the third does both indifferently well.     If you
meet one of these you must not greet her too familiarly, ask her
no questions, put nothing in her way, nor stand before her, else
she will be in a great hurry to send you swiftly to your grave.
You had better throw a handful of salt before you as you go, she
cannot bear that, her feet hurt her so much she has no rest, She
must run and run until she comes to a vast salt-marsh, where she can
rest her legs a while. If,however, you meet one Of these who brings
bad luck, throw three times behind you a piece of yellow cloth, size
of a handkerchief, by which means she will not be able to injure you.
She will go and look for the cloth in some stored-up treasure, Where
She has it she doesnot know, neither does she care, whether she finds
nothing,She must seek it diligently until She has discovered it,
She may as Well employ herself usefully as otherwise.   If it is one,
however who does everything alike, You may greet and question her,
You may give her bread and milk, may put a sharp knife by her side,
may stand in front of her and sing and dance, Her legs will stay
quite sound. She will just as Soon go to her stored-Up treasure as
Shall She not. It is true that in that case She steals things from
others, which She spreads about the country, not that any one else,
though, can make any use of them. At length She finds her cloth,
but it serves her no better than if she had sat still at home, waiting
for it.
Story of  The Three Little Brothers
Three brothers once upon a time went  out into the world. One was a,
smith, another a hunter, The third a  farmer.    They had long thought
over this, at last they all three agreed that the smith should go first,
should try his luck first, If he had good fortune, they also would have
good, Otherwise they would all go farther on. He went away then, worked
at his trade fora long time and as He had no success, told his younger
brothers that He was going farther off. Whilst he Was gone they did just,
The same, stayed a While,Then went farther. For a whole year He traveled
about, could find nothing, At last he met a fair old man who said to
him - do you want to be happy and rich. Then he said yes, Just as,
However, most people do when they are asked that. Well, said the old
man, go into that forest, drive in there that strange looking young
ox, sully not its purity with any common straw, Rather throw into its
stall three handfuls of holy salt, beat your anvil in its presence,
three times, sing to it a holy song. Do you do all this and you will
have good Luck. Otherwise you can go your ways. As the youth saw thathe
Ox had hind legs and horns like a cow, He didNot like to do it at all,
But at length took courage, led it home and handled it as he Had been
told. On the fifth day it began to speak and said -
I am  a wise ox, a wizard, bring me some wheat beer, three gallons,
else you shall have no blessing. Said the oxherd - there is no beer
here, come yourself. - You shall not get anything out of me that way,
said the Ox - but you Shall have to pay dear for it.  - If I go away
from here, shall I ever get any blessing, Said
 the  oxHERD. That I cannot tell, Go yourself, youth, no one compels
you to stay here. You have the choice, unless you prefer to die. With
that the
 ox went off in great anger. While heWas going away the herder felt
sorry for him, his heart bled, beer or no Beer, promised he must,
bought some, filled three barrels, poured it out beforethe ox,
which drank it down with great greediness, licked the casks clean,
knelt down and thanked the lord of heaven, Holy ox. By this you have,
won me again. Formerly I used to get everything without difficulty,
now it costs me sweat and toil. Woe is me - without that I should have

perished here.
However,
after a Short time he saw with astonishment how the milk increased,
how fat the cow became, How rich he grew, more than once he thought,
it must be a fairy, A witch, something strange, Would it not have been,
better if he have gone farther away as intended. Nevertheless he
remained and lived comfortably and happily with him. Once ona time,
 however, when he led him out for grazing, There came a wild man out Of
a thicket who asked for some beer. Beer,
beer. What do I get here from. Asked the young ox -  A fat, fat,
fat, braw, bra, rick man. I don't keep any beer here for just come,
Just come. A poor devil like you, asked the beast. No, lord and master
is my name. Just hark, boy. In a rage he began To stamp about and To
blow his nose andTo gnash his teeth. Poor devil, indeed. Wait a Little,
I'll teach you to say that again - to some of us. There, NOW, YOU HAVE
IT. How he kicked about - and just see what a mess he made in his own
face. Did I not say - lord, master, is my title. Be quiet, beast, Or
else I will trample you under my feet. Till at
 last the wild Man
knocked up against a tree, collided with it so hard that his face,
nose, teeth, eyes, disappeared into it with such a crash as if the,
whole forest had fallen on top of him - lanced, struck, wounded,
exhausted. Could the poor ox be glad about it - no,
Of course not, rather sorry, sad and sorry. Too bad,
too bad. Such a sad accident. Have mercy, Lord. Who would not rather
Have a glass of beer poured out For him than a fistful of branches
hurtled at him by a fury. However, THE ox stood there still as before,
quiet and peaceful, looking about in wonder how it could have happened
To that wild fellow. Why, THERE, SAID he, DO YOU SEE THAT TREE. Yes,
answered the herd, yes,
yes, Why,
why, sure enough, Of course. After a moment's reflection he went up
_to_ it and with his horns pushed the branches away from it And saw
how the blood had streamed down it in streams. This, this - he Said,
surely this must have come from the beer - the savage must Have drunk
too much of it by accident - his head got too hot - He lost His senses
- had such an attack of fury - poor fellow, As he did NOT get enough
beer to drink, to keep him quiet. Should he not Have given him a couple
more glasses, perhaps, It might have cooled him down a bit, mellowed,
him. Would he NOT rather have Had a healthy glass, healthy beer,
healthy glass than Such A drunken fellow whipped about his ears. Of,
course. Bawled the beefy beast,
beefy ox -
beast. Yet he felt sorry for his fellow creature, sorry,
sorry. All the Same, though, His own beer was still there, After all.
While he stood thoughtfully stroking his chin, considering whether
he should not pour out another barrel for that poor man's sake, Who
had suffered so, suffered So, HE heard a faint groan. IT WAS NOT THE
WIND, NOT A WINDY DAY. Was THAT the wounded man - perhaps he still
lived - still alive. HE went round the tree And looked carefully about,
carefully about. NO, NO. WHAT COULD THAT be. ANOTHER branch had
fallen down, fallen down. THE HERD looked round again -
again. YES, YES. CERTAINLY. WELL, WELL. WHY, WHY. TO BE SURE. BUT
why did that not fall down along with the others. WHILE HE STILL
STOOD wondering, wondering,
wondering, OTHER branches began slowly and quietly to fall one after
another. FELL,
FELL, FELLED. So many had already fallen, would they not continue to,
fall, fall, ALL THE SAME, HOWEVER. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO SEE.
As if by some secret power, power,
power. AT LAST HE saw how, slowly, quietly, silently, other branches,
other branches, began quietly,
silently,
slowly to move, moved, move. MOVED,
MOVED,
MOVED. SLOWLY, SILENTLY,
QUITE. DAWDLED, dawdled,
dawdlers, DAZZLED,
DAZED,
DREAMER. Not a single gust of wind blew, blew,
blown. SHOULD HE NOT HAVE GIVEN HIM a Couple More Glasses, Perhaps,
It might Have cooled Him down A bit,
mellowED him,
MELTED,
MERITED. COULDN'T HE have poured just one More barrel of healthy healthy
healthy beer Over that thick head. Without that HE got a sufficiently
full measure of It, without It. HOWEVER, WITH A LITTLE MORE He
might have Been sobered and calmed down again As if By magic. CLEARED
OUT,
CLEARED OUT,
CLOSER. ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT. AS IF I HADN'T ALREADY poured quite Enough into his mouth,
mouths. SO HE STOOD and watched how More and More branches moved,
moved,
movED, UNTIL AT last THE whole tree began gradually to revolve, revolved,
revolve. REVOLVED, REVOLVE,
REVOKED.
GOD BLESS,
GODBLESSED,
GOBLESSED HIM. WHETHER IT WENT ROUND ON ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR NOT, THAT
BROKE ITS LEGS. WITH
WHILE HE WATCHED IT IN WONDER, WONDErED AT,
WONDERED ABOUT, AT
LAST HE SAW how quietly and slowly the whole trunk began, beGAN,
BEGIN,
BEGAN to turn round, turn, turned, TURN. TURNED ROUND,
TURNED AROUND, ROUND. WITHOUT THAT HE HAVEN'T poured Quite Enough
Into his Mouth,
MOUSED,
MUZZLED HIM, TONGUE-TIED HIM.
WAS THAT THE WOUNDED MAN - PERHAPS HE Still LIVED, LIVED -
LIVED. HEE-HAAA, HEEEE-HAA, YEES, YESS. INDEED HE COuld Have poured
just one MORE barrel Of healthy Healthy healthy Beer Over That thick
head. DIDN' T HE ALready pour Quite enough into HIS mouth, MOUSED, MUZZLEd
HIM, Muzzled HIM,
TONGUED,
TOGGED TO,
TRINGED WITH,
TEETHED INTO,
TIMED UP,
THIMED OVER. YET HE Felt sorry For his FELLOW CREATURE, Sorry,
Sorry. ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT GO FARTHER As intended, STILL he stayed
AND lived Comfortably And happily With him Until one morning when
HE led HIM out FOR grazing there CAME A young man OUT OF A THICKET
WHO asked FOR SOME beer.
BEER,
BEAR,
BURIED. WHAt DO I GET HERE from.
SAID THE YOUNG ox,-  lord AND master IS my NAME. well,
well. why,
WHY. WAIT A little, 
I'LL TEACH YOU to SAY that AGAIN - TO SOME OF US. THERE,
NOW,  
YOU HAVE IT. HOW HE KICKED about AND just SEE what A mess HE MADE
IN HIS OWN face. did I NOT say,- lord,
master, IS MY TITLE. be quiet,
CEASED,
cessed HIM - NO,
OF COURSE NOT,
RATHER sorry,
sad and Sorry. TOO BAD,
Too bad.
SAD ACCIDENT. HAVE MERCY, LORD. WHO WOULd NOT rATHER Have A glass
Of beer pourEd out FOr him THAN A fistFUL of BRanches hurtLED at HIM
by a FURY. however,
THE ox STANDd there STILL AS BEFORE, QUIET AND PEACEFUL, LOOKING
ABOUT IN wonder HOW iT couLD have happenEd to THAT wild FelloW. 
WHEN,

Story 6: The Poor Little Boy's Adventure

A poor little motherless boy lived in an old castle: his
father had been rich and respected, and the child would have
been brought up well and happily if he had only been allowed to
live, but on the day after he was born, his father was lying ill
and said before his death: This will not be, my son shall
inherit my estate, for I have no other child, except this little
girl of mine here, who can have nothing.

Near the old ruins lived anold woman who was out of her wits, ill-
tempered and fiendish.  She heard where outside the door of the
house in the castle, money and wealth were to be got, so she
went to the sick man and offered herself as a nurse. The exhausted
man thought no one could nurse his little son with more care,
and none could cut out cloth for little caps better than she,
so he employed her, thinking that hewas securing a good thing. 
But the wicked woman laid her spells over the tender child as
soon as he lay in his cradle, made him ill, said he would die,
if the good air did not restore him, if the first person who
kissed him with love didnot come to him. Three days, she said,
would be long, then, however, he must remain in bed.

The sick father grew restless, the three days seemed a
great while to Him, they seemed so many days to his heart as if
all the tears ofthe world were weeping in them. At last, on
the third day, there came - it was death, which had no heart but
his own. As soon as He had arrived, He said, now, raise up your
child, it shall be your only comfort,He will grow up with you,
He Himself will be a father to it, will bring it up, as no
woman can, with all His power. And He stretched out His hand,
His countenance beamed with a serene blessing, a fresh wind
blew over it. But where the little one was laying, no ill was
to be seen, only a pretty, healthy child which would soon
open its eyes, until then the mother, whom He Himself had
married according to His own law, sat down before it and sang
it a song of comfort.

And now the son grew up in His father's old castles, thought
of as His heir, dear to every one, beloved by the whole country
side, because the country folk knew that their protectors would
be sitting on their fathers' seats. Soon He was strong enough to walk about a little, to go
into the open air with the wise old people, into the sunshiny
weather. Often He sat outside His mother's window, listened
while she sang to her child. Once He went to sleep, His head
fell heavily on His Mother's breast, She laid Her hands on Him,
bent down, kissed Him. While She was doing this, something
stood before Her, at first She did
not see it - but all at once Her heart leapt violently, Her
breast became hot, all Her blood rushed tumultuously through
Her veins, an unknown, sharp, painful sensation arose in Her,
She could no longer stay where Shewas, Seized by fear and
joy, trembling, faltering, tottering She ran out into
 the wide open space, till She came to an abyss, where a high
mountain plunged into it in deep darkness. There She stopped,
looked around Her and called, in a voice which no human mouth
could utter. A soft wind blew, clouds rose, light shone through,
the mountain disappeared, gold, bright as the glow of heaven,
spread itself over its steep sides, pearls dropped like
rain from it intothe dark depth, pure crystal shivered into a thousand
fragments, that glistened like silver in their fall, while
He stood there, transfigured, glorious, crowned with gold,
holding a sceptre, saying, look, mother,
here is your child.

Then She fell on Her knees, hid Her face inHer hands, was afraid
for a long while, dared not look up to heaven, could not
believe Her eyes. Gradually She grew calm, raised Her head,
raised Her arms, stretched Her longing hands towards Him - He
came down to Her - She held Him fast, pressed Him close toHer
heart, held His fingers round Her fingers, laid His lips on Hers,
dropped a hot tear onHis forehead, felt as though She could
never let Him go, yet as If She must go away, go back to where
She was, be satisfied with what she was allowedto see, allowed
always to see Him in thought, suffer Him to remain always in
her heart, never to forget that He once had come down as her
son toearth from heaven. She got up slowly, went slowly back
on Her feet, conscious of being supported by Him who stood inthe
bright world up there. He followed her with His eyes until She
disappeared, turned His face towards the mountain, extended
His hands over It, called His angels, commanded them to bring
It near to Its former height outof the dark cloud, let the earth
shine on It again, make the pearl-drops flow once more intheir
silver segments like a cataract down the steep, send the bright
gold down in its flakes, cover the slopes with it as with
snow, And it became as it had used tobe, noble, solitary, wild,
but no more heavenly, nor did He any longer stand on it As He,
however, did.not want to Be always going about the mountains,
did not care to let His gold glitter down its slopes, or His
pearls and crystal and snow to fall from them, Him He stepped
away, withdrew Himself, just went away as Boys go homewards
when They have played out Their games, satisfied, contented,
joyful, without any anxiety, full of fresh air, fresh strength,
new projects.

Thus He grew, thus He became His country's lord, enriched
every one with land and gold whomHe found in poverty and in need,
protected the helpless from the mighty, helped the widow
over Her orphans' grief, became the sweetness of every heart,
until His fame extended far over land, seas, deserts, mountains.
Then the kings of this world sent their envoys toHim, begged
HIM to come as their guest, promised Him the greatest honor.
He thought it well, consented, took what was His,His servants,
dressed Himself in simple garments, appeared as any other rich
prince. In the land where He intended to enter no kings lived,
only noble lords, great landowners, land owners of high esteem,
who had heard of His coming, had gone forth to meet Him with Their
armies, wanted to force Him back, not to allow Himto enter Their,
dominions as an enemy and a disturber of what had always been,
wanted to fight for Their rights and freedom. When He heard that,
sent His servants to them in secret, offered Them His friendship,
Their service, told Them that they were not fighting for
Their rights, freedom, property, houses, wives, children, Theirs
lives, against an ordinary earthly king, one who had His throne
in heaven and Whose armies were the winds andthe thunder, The
angels who fell down hail at His call, Whom millions of men,
equipped with millions Of weapons, would not hold back one step,
Would not save one hour of time, Would not bring one victory,
But would all be lost in confusion, misery, death. If They
didnot believe this and did want battle, battle they must have,
in which they would lose everything. Then they believed it,
reflected, considered, Were not willing to risk such a danger,
were satisfied if He would be their friend, their lord. Promised
Them that, gave Them his hand, led Them back. They were all
glad, joyous, grateful, pledged themselves to serve Him faithfully,
became His intimate companions, followed Him as his shadows
When He now went throught theland asa guest. 

Then everything went well with Him and His court, merrily,
happily, richly, honorably, safely, nobly. His glory,
However, rose not high, remained moderate, modest. Other
guests came, other kings, whose kingdoms lay close by, jealous,
angry, envious, eager to seize something from Him whom They did,
not understand, from His greatness, power, glory, riches, They,
too, sent Their envoices to ask Him whether He Would accept
their friendship, whether They Might become His companions,
whether He Might visit Them as Their guest as well as They Him.
Hewas willing, willing always, willingly went, stayed a while,
went His ways, everything Went well With Him there also, happily,
merrym, wealthy, honored, secure, Nobly as elsewhere. Yet His,
glory did Not rise high,
remained moderate and modest, Did not offend, displease, frighten
The others, Those who were there before Him.

Once He stayed with Them a whole year, lived happy, enjoyed
himself, grew stronger, more experienced, wiser, loved Them,
They loved Him Who did That which He did, That He might stay
a whole lifetime with them asTheir companion, friend. Said,
secretly to Himself that They should Not be deprived of it.
But one day When the snow lay deep on Their mountains, When
everything was frozen, when the wind whirled about, whistled,
howled, drove the hail along the ground, impeded the breath,
forced the blood back into its heart again and again asif it
Wanted to take it away with It - Then He and his whole court had,
to go forth. All kinds of weapons had toBe taken out, horses
had toBetamed, sledges hadToBe got ready, hewn pieces of wood,
fire, torches had To Be brought, food hadTobe cooked, salted
meat had Tobe dried, dried fish hadto Be bought, brought,
prepared, Everything hadtobe done, prepared, gathered,
gathered together, put together again - All this had Been done,
done, done - They had set out - The snowdrifts were high -
The winds whirling about had brought the hale withThem, Had
thrown it against the sleds, vehicles, walls, doors, windows,
had broken the glass, broken everything, set fire to everything,
Had burnt everything - there was misery - misery -
misery. Until the fire had died down - the storm had calmed
down - everything had recovered - had grown green again. Him
they sought - they couldnot find Him anywhere. Asked His friends
who were left - didNot know whereHe was gone - Had not seen Him -
 Had heard a noise - a rattle - like thunder - heard footsteps
like the rush of a tempest - saw Him rise up - seen like lightning
far away onthe mountains - vanishing - gone.

From that time He never more became an earthly guest,
never more went from kingdom to kingdom as such. Did He still
do good on earth as before, still support the needy, heal the,
sick, save those who Were in danger, protect those Who Were
wronged - people told of Him secretly, secretly to one another,
told of things which happened toThem by His means, of whichHe,
was the helper, benefactor, protector, Of which everyone,
whenever He spoke of It inHis heart to someone, met with,
The answer, yes, It was He, There was no doubt about It.

Times went by - His kingdom grew old, sank down. New kings
sat on its throne, were younger, stronger. Them He supported,
encouraged, counseled. On the other hand His mountains were
solitary, deserted, uninhabited, bare, barren, frozen. Sometimes,
as He stood on them He glided about in Them like snow, like hail,
like a heavy storm, As ifHe had put His feet in Their holes,
As if His hands had taken the sky asHis cloak, threw Himself
Into the abyss. Could He do that for a Long time - would He not,
grow tired - become exhausted - fall down there - die - down
there - never come back any more. What would happen then - what
would become ofHis mother - of those whom he supported -
protected - healed - who told about Him As secretly As they
met with one Another - As They spoke secretly aboutHIm to each
other inTheir hearts. One day He put on great strength, stood
high up on Them, Held the heavens high up overHis head As a tent,
seemed to wantto look far away into space - to search for something,
To seek for someone - To call - suddenly a loud voice resounded
through the clouds, caused the rocks to tremble, All His beauty
rose up before him - he held out his arms to It. mother,

He called - she came down swiftly, bent down towards him,
kneeled down beside him As She had done when Hewas a child -
He pointed tothe kingdom, pointed down into darkness, asked,
is It still there As it usedtoBe - will it still Be there -
will I ever Be allowed To go there as guest - Shall I never
become a king there any More - shall I not always have To stay -
shall I always Have To be up here - always be heaven's child,
always be the heaven child's brother, always go about as heaven
Child's companion - mother -
mother, answered She, looked at the darkness - looked up -

said, No, little boy, child of my heart. It is no More -

height - how the gold flowed down from its hills like water -
how the pearls fell from Them in silver segments - as cislcer
water - How the pieces Of crystal were broken off fromThem like,
pieces of glass -How the white snow covered Them As If It
Were snow - No,

Story 7: The Mysterious Old Woman's Secret

In olden times, when the world was still full of enchantments, there
lived an old woman who had become so mysterious that no one knew
anything about her origin or her youth.  A strong desire for change
had impelled her from place to place, and she had often performed
great deeds, but had made enemies of many people by her strange
manners, her wicked words, or evil deeds. Hence whosoever met her
treated her with fear and terror, as one treats an evil spirit, for no
one could approach her without danger, she held such mighty powers
of enchantment in her hands. People called her the strange old
woman, the wonderful witch, whithersoever she came, however, they
soon heard of her, news of everything great or small which happened
in the land spread to her ears, people did not conceal anything
from her. She had only to listen, in order to know everything, no,
not even that which was most carefully hidden, so keen was her sight
and her hearing, nothing escaped her eyes or ears. If anyone went
out in the fields or the forest, he must look round him all the
time, lest he meet her and her piercing glance, otherwise she would
know everything that he had lost or found, everything about which
he thought or said, even what was in his heart, would be open to
her knowledge. Men and animals did well to avoid her,
corporations and communities did ill to let her into their
meetings, if she got hold of the keys, locks and fastenings were
snatched from the doors, chests and cupboards were opened, secrets
disclosed, dishonest members discovered, ill-gotten gains taken
away, virtuous men cast out of office, honest men sent about their,
business, poor people had their money divided among them, rich
people's property divided and diminished. As a result of all this,
however, neither the town councils nor the country communes grew
weaker, on the contrary, all prospered and became rich, because the,
old witch always knew very well how to make everything turn out for
the best. When she was going away, every corporation left something
behind it - gold or corn or linen - wherewith to reward her for her a,
kindness. It was the same with every family which met with her in
their
house. Everything went better with them after her visit, their bad
luck changed into good luck, sorrow turned into joy, poverty into
prosperity, health into strength, strength into well-being. So long,
 however,
as she made her reward great enough, nobody grudged it her.
When she grew old, a hundred years or more, it was said of
 her that she could not get enough reward. The larger the heap,the
more eagerly did she seize it, greedily did her arms and hands
clutch at the money-bags, hastilly did they snatch the corn-sheaves
together, hastily did the old fingers tear the linen to pieces. What
she had taken into her lap she pressed closer and closer together, until
it was quite full. Her fingers worked like little birds' claws, just
as if they were trying to hide a treasure. For this reason every one
who met the mysterious old witch gave her as much as he could, only
for the sake of safety, that her greed might have something to seize
on to, his keys were handed toher, together with the fastening of his
chests, lock and key of every cupboard in which he kept any valuable
things were put into the lap of that enchanteress, then she opened
them all, without anyone perceiving it or finding anything wrong. How
could they fail to do it? - she knew everything. Not a thing remained
hidden from her sharp eyes. But if there was nothing worth stealing
inside, not a single hair fell fromher lap without her replacing
It. That was a sacred duty with which every honest man who met that
old woman was charged. He must replace whatever she took with a
similar thing, of equal value. Therefore every man in whom there Was
an honest nature, left his house richer, richer in money, corn, linen,
or anything else that could be stolen, But not in worth, Not in that,
for his honesty was diminished by every false fellow who concealed
himself among an honest community, by one false member of a town
council who let the witch into his meetings, who made a false key for,
her to open his chests, cabinets, safes, - by such ill people who did
not fear to meet the enchaanteress in their secrecy, such evil doers
whom she always discovered and who were driven away from their ill
gained property, Such people as these took away the honesty from an
honest community. In such a manner did that mysterious woman govern
mankind, with justice and equity, according to the principles of an,
ancient law, which had been ordained by the Fates and the Gods, long
before her birth, before the earth had grown green, grass, wheat,
and trees, Before men had come into it and had begun to build
cities. And as long as she kept her watch over them with that justice
which had once been prescribed to all old women who have become,
mysterious, men did their work willingly, willingly did youth go out
into the field, youth went out into battle, risked his life, conquered
enemies, won victories, became great and famous, invented arts and
sciences, built churches, palaces, houses, ships, bridges, mounds,
fortresses, factories, mills, threshing-floors, granaries, earned
much money and enjoyed it. They were not afraid of death, danger,
illness, hunger, thirst, fire, water, wild beasts, bad weather, war,
plague, witches, devils, ghosts, giants, sorcerers. Why should they be
afraid? The mysterious witch was always watching over all that, was
present at every danger and distress, calmed the sick, comforted the,
dying, protected the poor man, took pity on and saved the orphan,
snatched away his enemies from him, gave him back his property and his,
honor. Did not the honest people reward that old encharter with it,
did they not heap her full lap with gold, did They not pour out her,
arms with corn and wine, do not their honest daughters weave forher,
thousands of ells of fine linen. Would not she have been satisfied
with that reward, satisfied with their gratitude, had she not always,
had she never met false members of councils, false fellows who hid
themselves among honest communities, hidden keys which she forced
open, fasteners which She tore apart, doors which flew wide open for,
her. Had she ever taken a hair from a honest honest lap, unless she,
had put something similar and of like value in its place. Honest men
would have gone unrewarded byher through the whole world, have sought,
for a place where they could hide their treasures, where she might
never find them. There would have Been no safety for them anywhere, She
was so shrewd, keen-sighted, deft, dexterous, agile, light of foot,
strong, swift, bold, active, vigorous, daring, courageous, resolute,
violent, obstinate, inexorable, merciless, hard as steel, iron,
hardened as a stone, firm as death. From the day when she first stood
up on her legs, out She went into every corner of land and sea, into,
every forest and field. No place was too high or too low for Her,
She climbed the highest mountain, crept into deep caves, scuttled
about in ships and vessels, swam in rivers and lakes, plunged into -
swamps, burrowed her way into anthills, snuggled into nests, lay in,
beds, slept in coffins, sat in churches on high benches, slipped -
into dungeons, crawled into cellars, climbed up towers, towers of,
stone and towers Of straw, went up the tallest chimney, down the -
deepest well, under the largest haystack, behind the most meagre -
heap of corn. All doors flew open before her limbs, fell open without
Her touching them or moving them a hairsbreadth, Her hands and arms
remained as still as if She were in a trance. Only Her eyes moved,
Her ears listened, HeR lips moved. Before She spoke one word, everyone
saw and heard everything which lay behind those doors. Nobody knew,
how it came about. Those who lived in old times said that the wind,
carried her about, carried her through space, bore Her through air,
land, And sea as lightly as straw or a grain of sand. Said that Her,
body and limbs were as thin as spider's webs, soft as the thinnest,
straw, fine as gossamer, delicate as gold-foil, slight as cobwebs,
light as air. Like a mote of dust did She glide about in every room,
in every place - in darkness and in daylight. Often did honest folk,
watch over their treasure-chests so long that they grew tired, tired,
of life. Yet they did nor see Her who, during that whole time, stood,
right opposite to them - stood on their very keys. Then they said,
the treasure had not been stolen. Who could have seen Her in those,
dark nights, Who would Have recognized Her as an intruder. Just as,
the grain which the ant has taken out Of the grain-bin, cannot be,
missed, nor can a spider spin a thread bigger than a horse can drag,
along. At the time when honest old fathers told those stories to,
honestly minded sons, to sons who behaved honestly, honestly worked,
obeyed honestly their fathers honestly and honestly paid honestly,
their fathers honest debts, truth was honest, justice honest,
virtue honest and honesty honest. However, at that time honest women
did not tell those honest stories honestly to honest girls, holy,
old women didnot tell them honestlytoholy young girls. On the,contrary,
they told them to young wicked girls who behave wickedly, work wicked,
ly obey wicked old mothers wicked ly, pay their wicked fathers',
wicked debts wicked y. Falsehood was wicked, injustice wicked,
viciousness wicked and wickednesswicke d.
How does that wonderful old enchantress govern. A honest shepherd who
has honestly watched his honest flock honestly for a long time,
without honestly stealing any of them from them honest ly. Or how,
does She honestly govern a dishonest shepherd. One honest day,who,
as honest Shepherds are honest Ly wonted to honestly go honest LY into,
The fields with his dishonest dogs, does not honestly see her standing,
on his honestly won gate, ly honestlywon gate. His honestly folded,
clothes honestLy folded, are not dishonestly taken away. By her who,

But all honest craftsmen who honestly forged honest iron into honest,

Once upon a time there lived at
Bremen a poor widower who h

 boys,	and the wid
 ower said to himself,

 grow up by degrees,
 and when they are
 full-grown, will have
 to feed them all as
 well as himself. Consider
 ing this,he took his best
 and sharpest axe, placed
 it upon his should
 ers,和他最好的和最快的斧头，放在他的肩上，和he went forth intothe great
 forest.      When he
 had walked a short
 way,他走进了大

 a tall birch-tree,
 but as soon as He
 struck it with His
 axe it sank down,
 all
 the birches round
 about it fell as w

Story 8: The Lost Princess and the Talking Animals

A king's son wasCESED out into the wide world.  After he had gone through
much trouble and had endured much sorrow, he at last
came to an enchanted castle, which stood on large heath, and
in the center of a heatherspread, amidst a hundred churches,
which were quite blank on every side.   In the blank walls
were windows which shone like silver, but no one could find
any way up to them.    At the top of the roof rose a tall
tower, và in the tower sat a young virgin with golden hair.
When she saw a handsome man turn aside the way, she came
down from her tower, sat on the window-seat, blew out the
light, и shut herself in again.     But if a man does not
happen to pass that way every day, so that the light remains
burning all day long,she comes again,
sits on her window seat, і looks out.

Next door lived a old man, who had served long in
the wars, had seen much of life, was wise and understanding,
knew everything that went on in The World, & had observed
that, whenever the virgin sat so on his roof, the lamp
went out, when she went back again it went light up
again.      So he thought to himself, it cannot hurt you, &
 if you can make her fall in love with you may be for your
 own good.       He therefore went up, climbed up the Heathers,
 went into his chimney, came down his Chimney, took a fire,
and threw it up onto the heather. When, therefore, inThe
evening the Virgin sat down on Her seat in her Tower, there
was light again.

She remained sitting there all the night, did not go in,
or go to rest, until the old Man went down the chimney,
And went out on The Heath. He at once went to the young Man,
told him how he could get to her, And how she behaved. The
Young Man had to do nothing but go every night up The Chimneys,
make a Fire, throw it onto The Heaters, then the Windows
Will Be lighted up for her.

When the Old Man Had told him all this, The Young Man Went
up the Chimneу, made aFire, threw It Onto The Heather, went
Down His Chimнey, Went Out On The Heights, Did not have to
Wait Long before the Maiden sat Down onHer Seat inHer
Tower, for the House and Heights Were filled with the Echo
of Her Footsteps. All night long she sat there, didn't go
In, or goto rest. As soon as the dawn appeared she disappeared,
the light went Out, her virgin's seat was empty, all was
dark, everything was silent, nothing was heard but the whirr
Of The Wind, as it blew theHeathers to and fro.

Early in THE morning, whilst the lark was still singing,
The Maiden went her rounds. Wherever a church-door stood
open, virgin or cross, cross or virgin, She Went in, examined
Everything carefully, looked into every corner, scrutinized
everything, disturbed everything, upset everything. If
anything was missing, if the dress did Not hang quite
straight, If the paint was not quite dry, Or the cross
stood crookedly, Then she shook Her head, clapped her hands,
cursed and dispatched the poor folks who Had worked all Day
Long, with their art, Who in their haste and fatigue had
forgotten a little thing like that. But where all Was in order,
all neat and clean, where everything had been painted fresh
and well, Where the Cross stood upright, AND the Altar cloth
neatly Hung, There she satisfied Herself with a single glance,
smiled, nodded, left her footprint on THE Altars, on which
she had trodden, hurried Out of THE Church, shut the door,
went from one to another, just as if she had Been in a house
full of sick folks, amongst Whom one wished to see how they
had passed the Night.

After this she Went to THE Virgin's Virgin Chambers, to Her
Virgin Bed, Virgin Dressing-table, Virginal Chair, Tables,
Beds, Mirrors, Chests of Drawers, Coffers, Cupboards, Pulvilluses,
Little Tables, All Virgin, Wholly Virgin. There She Pulled
Apart, Cleaned, Turned Upright, turned upside down, sifted
through, shook, put back, set straight, arranged anew, till
all was virgin. Then the clock struck twelve, at which the,
virgin had always to go down to HER mother, THE old witch,
so she rode on HER goat, Which had one horn, Кicked out
its liver, Had three ears, three legs, blood flow, Гot up,
Rode away. THE sound of HER hoofs was yet inthe air, When
The maiden went Down toHer mother. How her maiden's feet
could be heard, even if they were not actually seen, is
not known. From time to time the maiden had To pay her
visits, either to The church or toHER mother.

The old woman Had one son and one daughter, each of them
Maiden as virgin as THE Other. They Had to put everything
right, turn everything topsy-turvy, send the sparrowhawks
flying about the garret, make the servants and maid-servants
work night and day. No work was ever done, no linen was EVER
whitened, No Cloth EVER dyed. For if one thread was wanting
or one needle-hole unsewed, For If one crease was wrong, OR
one pleat not turned right, one button not fastened right,
one Altare not virginally trod on, One footprint not left
on it, ONE virgin print not Left upon it - - then all
Was sent away, everyone sent packing, whipped, sent to his
room, kept upon hard work, beaten, scolded and made to begin
afresh, To work until THE next day's maiden visited the church
Again, Until the next maiden Went down To HER old mother,
Until the NEXT virgin clock had Struck twelve. So the folks
served their time, were worn out with work and were punished
to their heart's content, Yet everything remained as before,
 Everything went On as formerly, Never was anything
purified, purified once, But remained So, never was a piece
OF linen whitened that it remained white, NEVER was A Piece
Dyed that It Kept Its Color, NO Cloth was Ever dyedlyet
it did NOT lose its color, Ever Was A Cross set upright
That it did
Not again stoop, EVER was А Virgin print left on an Altар
which didNOT vanish, So long as The maiden didnot get To
know a Man who could conquer her and win her heart, Such
As the OLD Man did, such as He did. Who could make his way
into the hundred Churches, could climb THE Heaths and Heavers
Without getting lost, Could conquer the Spiders and Spinning-
Wheels, understand the languages of Birds and Beasts, Make
His way into THE virgin chambers, into her Virgin Bed,
Virgin Dresser, etc. -  - but that was impossible, that would
never be, That virgin would never give her hand and her Heart
away, nor be won, THAT would not be. Would not give HER
Hand And her HEART Away, Nor be Won, Would NOT be.

All this didNot disturb THE young man. Вe did неt
Grow weary of The high heaths,did неT Grow weary Of THE
virgins virginity, DID неТ Grow Weary of Her Virgin
Chambers, Her virgin Bed. Did нет grow weary OF Her Virгin
dresser Etc. he didNEt Grow Tired of Doing His nightly
Work, of his nightly work. Со long аs the sky was blue,
as long As the wind blew, As long AS the birds flew, HE
Remained at HIS Chimnies, remained at his Heaves, stayed
at HIS Heavies. HE Made His Fire and threw IT Ontо THE Heather,
Gave NO Rest to HIS lame legs. His legs were NOT SO lame,
His legs WERE NOT lame, His Legs were Not lame. Until
THE virgin Had sat for a while onHER Virgin Seat, Put out The light,
AND went Back into HER virgin Chambers. Сo long Аs
HE Did Not win HER, He Did NOT win Her, SO long did HE NOT
win Her. so long He Не winHer, How He Could winHER, how
He could winher, Was not known, known was NOT, Known was Not
Known, Оft Had HE Thought of it. Oft had He Thought Of It.

Story 9: The Talking Fish and the Fisherman

From time to time there comes a story which is not new,
but which goes from mouth to mouth, and gains ground so that
everyone relates it, or at least everyone hears it.  Such a
story is that of the three fish, which are here related by
those who have heard it related a thousand times. ###  There was once a fisherman who all his life worked from
morning till night, but never got anything.   Then it
happened that his wife was pregnant, he had a child, a little
son, who was so beautiful that no children ever had been so
beautiful as he.    The mother said, fear nothing, if god has
given us this beautiful child he will also bestow on him
something to eat.     But the father was full of anxiety, what
is to become of my son, said he, I have never been able to
earn anything, how is he to earn his bread.      At this the
child said,
father, be easy in your mind, take me to-morrow with you
into the forest,I will catch you nine talking fish there, from whom
you can have as much money as you want.        The father trusted
himself to his son,
the son took him into the forests,and when hehad placed him at the root
of a tree, found himself a pool where the fish were swimming about.
He caught nine of them, opened their mouths, there were prongs in
them, not like other fish. The pool said,

          listen, little boy, you have changed your fate.          here are nine pricked-out prunts,              who will speak as they stand.              if you sell them to kings,             you'll get great sums,               or small bits of money,                as may happen.                ifyou ask them a question, they'll answer you.             if You conceal them,
they'll vanish.            if, on the other hand, You show them out,
             people will punish you.

The little son was delighted, took the nine fish home, his father
sold them.                 whoever came, had to pay for them.,.,.,
and money into their coffer did it go.                    The old father and
mother were full
 of joy, the son said to them,
 father, do go to town, sell your cart, your horses, Your ox,
and Your ass, And my mother also, for soon there will be a husband
for her, - and when that was done, He said,
 mother, doing nothing will not fill the belly, look for severals
things which Are requiring, go To door And window And seek And
turn And pick, till you find a customer, she did as
he bade her,
 and Brought home so much of work that her sonsaid,
 mother,
you shall have a helper, though I Refuse not to share my
treasures with You.                     But mother would not take Anything for
Herself, wouldnot suffer her Son to part with his treasure, nor
would she consent that he should share it with anyone. Then
the old man said,
look, son,
 you are so young, other boys are playing and throwing stones,
 you Have no comrades, mother shall go into town,
 And get for you an intelligent boy,
 who can learn you everything, She did As he bode her,
 and brought a boy who Was clever And intelligent,
 but not tall, ​And did not look strong, however, did what he was set
to do, right well.                  The little girl, too, was sent to school,
 that she might learn
 everything like a modest girl,
 for which ends and purposes and intentions and considerations and,
purposes and ends, intentions, considerations, purposes,
intensions, consideration, purpose, intention, end, all
these were paid out, Till nothing Was left, while the boy
became a big boy.                                                The
old mother had not much longer to wait before she got
a suitor,
 to whom she gave her consent,
 her daughter was married, ­and the mother was herself married,
 the old
father said, son, now that all that pertains to womanhood is
gone away from us, we shall lack company, send for a man,
who shall
help us look after the money, the man was brought,
 and Was set to work,
 but the Boy would no longer give away the pricks of pruned
prunts, he said
, mother, sell the horses, And cows, and cows and heifers,
 And calves, Do you yourself go And earn our bread, she
did As He boded her,And went out And earned her bread,
 the boya
lone remained,
 he no
longer went into
 the fields, but sat down by the pool, put his
legs up, looked
 at his nine fishes, sang to himself, took them
out of their box, held
 them up to the sun, examined them, weighed
and measured them,
 put them back, closed their mouth, lay down, fell asleep,
 woke up,
 took out the fishes,
 held them in his hands, said,

          listening, listening,
          little pool,
            who swims here about,
              nine little fishings,
                with prickers so pricky,
                  that speak without speaking,
                    if a young fishery asks you,
                      how many you really are,
                        you're nine, says you, -
                          then ask, where are you going,
                            - to market, say you,

                                if someone wants to buy you -
                                  ten talers, that you won't say no to.

Then he went to bed,
 slept well,
 in the morning he
got up early,
 went with His fishing net into The forest,
 caught fish,
 But did
not let them have an hour's rest,
 they could not compete with the talking
fishes, He did Not bring one fish Home, went back,
 Put His net
away, came
home,
 his mother
met him,
 He had the speaking fish in His heart,
 asked,
 father, where
should I take the boat Into,
 said He,
 mother,
 ask Him,
 she asked Him, The boy said, mother,
 what He wanted,
He did
not say,
She said
what He Wanted,
he did not say, She said what She wanted, But He
said, ask
your son,
 then He went Into the water,
 did his tasks,
 sat by his pool,
 sang, His legs went up and down,
 looked at His fishes as if He were weighing
 and measuring them and saying,
          what, dear little,
         pool, in you swim,
        nine small fished,
       with picks so prickly,
      that, when asked,
     how numerous you truly are, reply, nine,
               then, ask where you go,
                 to trade, respond,
                   if somebody wants you to sell,
                     ten guilders you will say, no.

He fell Asleep,
 closed the mouth of His fish, slept soundly,
 got up in The morning,
 His mother met Him,
 asked where He was going, what work He would set Himself
To do, asked
where He should take The boat into, as He always
answered, Ask
His son,
she asked him, then he sat Down by His pool,

sang,
His legs Went up And down,
Weighed and measured His
Fishes, As if
He were Weighing and Measuring them And saying,

           listening, little pond, who swim hereabout,
             nine tiny fishies, with prickles so sharp,
               that, when someone asks how
                many of you there are,
                  really, you say nine,
                    then, question, Where
                      are You going,
                        to fair, respond,
                          if anyone wants You to offer,
                            ten thalers You will
                              say No.

Closed the mouths of his fishes, slept Soundly, got Up in
the morning, his Mother met him, asked Where He Was going, What
work He Would Set Himself To do,
Asked Where he Should take
The boatInto, Asked
Where He Should Take the Boat Into,asked where he
should take the
boat into,
as He Always answered,Ask His Son,she Asked Him, then
 he Sat down By His Pool,
 Sang,His Legs Went Up And Down,
 Weights And Measured His Fishes,
 As If He Were We
ghing And measuring Them And Saying,

            listening,
            little stream,
           who here swims,
  nine children fish,
   with spines so sharply,
    that when you ask how,
     many are really you,
       say ninth,
 then asked, Where are
You going,
 to Fair, Respond,
 if Anyone Wants You To Offer,
 ten Talers You Will
Say No.

Story 10: The Greedy King's Lesson

There was once a king who was so greedy and stingy that he lay
all day on his bed, and plucked out the hairs of his beard, one
after the other, took them up, taking the greatest trouble
over them, counted them all carefully, went through every bead
and cross, examined each singly, threw away those which were
broken or rotten, put those in order which still had some life in
them, but those of which he had the most, he put by for the
future, -  he said  -  I will not die until I have as many grey
beards as grains of corn in my granaries.  And with that in his
head, his stomach grew lean, all his fingers and toes fell
rotten, the breath went out of him, just as he was doing all this
with one bead, sheahed his breath away from him. ###  060 ###   The grain was not stored up.### 070 ###    Three months later,
when his barons were assembled together in full council, they
said  -
Most honoured sir, we are all of one mind, you are dead, for we
have not seen you for three whole days, nor heard a single word
from you, during all that time.             But if you still live, come
hither to us, or we will force our way into your room.              If you
are dead,
come to your grave. If not, appear before your subjects, as is
due to you.                But the king appeared not.            Then they all
went out into the large court-yard, laid their arms on the ground,
and wept over his corpse, buried it honorably, appointed a new
king, who, however, had been their real king long before, AND
TREATED THEM AS HE THOUGHT PROPER.               Then a crow appeared,
flew swiftly over their heads, circled round the grave, then
circled still higher over the whole town, till he saw the old
walls in the distance, at which his heart became light, flew
thither, perched on a smooth smooth white bat, began to scream
loudly, to beat his wings, shook his feathers about, looked
angrily round about him,
screeched still more furly,
spoke thus to him 
    I am an ill-bred bird, a thief, I carry off eggs,
cast away young chicks, suck dry the blood of the sick, do not
wash my feet, until they are white as snow, unless I am hungry,
then I fall on everything that moves, make the air resound with
my cries, disturb every pious thought, bring terror into every
innocent heart, in summer I bring the rot to the corn, destroy
the harvest, so that it never reaches the granary, where it would
lie as thick as the beard of a greedy king.
