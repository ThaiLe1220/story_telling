Story 1: The Brave Young Girl and the Witch

There were once upon a time two sisters, the one rich andthe other poor. After the death of their parents,the poor one had nothing to live on except the confidence which she placed in her rich sister, that she will share her possessions with her.
I am sure, said she to her sister. You will not refuse me a little bread, and a drink, until I can earn something for myself. I am not able to walk any further, my feet are so sore, I have made such a long journey.
Give me some bread.  I will give you a gold louis in exchange for it,  said the rich woman, but produce it before you eat. The poor girl did not know that the loaves of bread were baked from straw,	and were consequently as light as feathers.	She swallowed the crumb of straw,
and gave the gold to the miller as wages. When she was all in order again,	the witch said toher, now carry that barrel of rye to Bremen, AND sell it there for as much money as you can get for	it. It is a clever barrel, if you say open, it opens,	and if_you say shut,	it shuts.	The girldid as she_was told, và went to bremen with the barrel	of rie, traveled the greater part of the night, и until
dawn drove the cart into a great forest,ِ where a robber sat out. Hi, thief, cried he, you are breaking branches off my
conifer.ِ I had fallen into	a bad place,َ thought the girl, і paid her
respects to	the robber,ַ shut up the barrels,­ and jumped nimbly
off her horse.­ Hi,
robber,  cried the robber again. If you do not immediately
go away  from my tree,і I
will tear  the  barrel  of  riek  out of  your  belly with
my pistol.	I am paying
hers respects to  him  too, thought
the girl. She
shut the
barrel, got
on her horsе,
rode out of
and did неt stop until she
reached bгeemеn.  There was no
boughter there, however, who wanted a barrel
of straw.َ She did
not get a single groschen for
her trouble. Then
she hired herself as
cook to
a captain,
who was
just going
to sea.    All
went well as long
as he was in
port,  but as soon as they were out at
sea, ­ two ships' guns ­ went off ­ and two more
were wrecked. And every
time two other ships went down two
sailors died. At
length, ​​ the two who were left were seized with such
anxiety that they hid in the forest,
­ waiting to see whether their
ship would go to pieces or
Not, ‐ and there the thie
sat behind the tree,
‐ and said, two guns,
two gone. ­ And
when he had
said that two times
over, he saw the last
two ships sinking
into the deep,
And the whole
crew perished.  Then he went
back to ­ the ship, -
and it lay
safe and
sound, - and sailed
securely into
harbour. But the country
girl,who had played such an important part
in this, was driven
by ­ a violent
wind ­ over the
ocean ­ untilshe came to  land, where
­ the captain
told her that
he could
no longer keep
Her, because she had caused
him such misery. "Here
stands a
tower," he said,
"no one can climb
that, unless good luck attends
Him, or bad
luck follows
Hér, yet
if you succeed,
I will take you
Back again." The
Girl­said,
"Héer, Hérer, is
it not
strange,
that I,
Who am so
small,
Should
Be so bold,
That I dare
Myself up
The high
hill,
If good
Luck goes
with me,
Or bad,
As soon
As I begin."
The
Captain answered,
"That is true,
My darling,
But try it,
You may be
Fortunate, too."
Then the Girl
Said
Full of fear,
"Now, may
God be my guide,
Farewell,
Dear sir,
He
Fails not to bid
you farewell,
May He
Bless you,
Sir,
All the while."
And
She
Plunged
Into the sea,
Swam
Over it
Till
­she came
To the tower.
But
there stood
below it a huge
Cyclops,
Which asked,

Story 2: The Magical Tree of Wishes

There was once an old man who lived in a little house in the
middle of a great forest, and he had neither wife nor children.
Besides the house, he also had an ox, which was trained to work
with the plough for one day inthe year.  On that day the old
man plowed with the ox a large field, harvested it, threshed
the corn, sifted it in his hand, laid it under the roof,and
thus stored it up for the next year.

Near his house stood a small hut, in which lived a girl who was
young and pretty, but so dumb that she could not speak a single
word. The girl had to tend the cows,-and in order that no harm
might befall them in_the forest-, the girl was obliged to sleep
in it with them. Mix a handful of the corn with their food, so
ran theold man's instruction, then in spring the cow will give
you a bunch of herbs, with which you may speak.

The ox worked faithfully until the last moment of his life, as
he was accustomed to do, after which the other cows gave the 
girl in_ the hut in-the forest a bundle of fine herbs.    The 
Girl took the herbs and laid them together in_a plate, put them
under her pillow,	and then slept amongst the cattle.	 When
daybreak came, she went to her old master and spoke thus. Gracious
sir duckfoot, how splendidly the year has passed away. Now the Cow
has given me my language back again, I will no longer lead an
idle life.

103: Once upon a time there was a prince who had lost the sight of one
eye, the_other eye he was forced to close continually on account of
a violent pain, henceforth he called himself a blind man, placed a
cloth over his eye,  and supported himself with a staff. One day
as he thus walked forth alone he heard a voice crying, help help.
He looked around to see whence it came. It was the maiden from
_the hut who called out to him. Oh, you blind old gentleman, be
so good as to help me. Unbind me, set me free. I am a enchanted
princess, held fast by magic powers.

Oh, forgive me,
forgive me
forgi
me
for God's sake,
for in my
life I
have never
seen anything
like it before.     What have you got there in your hands. Ask
nothing, say nothing. Only unbind the cord, free me from my bonds,
set me on my legs again. Three silver groschens I have not to
give you. If I set you free, where am I to get a club and rake
and plow ox. Would god I could, gracious sir duck-foot.   I was,
as you see, a poor orphan girl. My father left me nothing but a 
small plot of corn. Every year theox worked for me one single day, 
sowed my field and harvested and thrashed it. Then he gave me the  
grain, that I might have seed for another year, took his club 
and rake and plows and went back into the forest. After that he 
disappeared for a whole year at a_time. But in summer he always 
came at sunrise, slept during the day under a tree, until
dusk came and then went away again.

Blind old gentlemen,
blin
old gentlemen
oh, do but
free me and
set
on my feet
again. Help
help. Where
am I To
get a cluster
of silver
gruschen. What
do I care
about your
silver clusters,
free you,
how shall I do it,
where is the key,
the key.
I do not see it.
Do not distress
yourself,
I will free you.
Have patience,
only be quiet.
You shall be set
at liberty,
you shall stand
upon your feet.
Only be still,
and do_not be afraid.

Then he went up to the tree under which she was imprisoned,
looked well about him, felt around a long while, till at
last he found a very small key on the moss. With that He opened
He opened the chain which held her fast, He set her free and she
stood upright on her legs. She thanked him a thousand times,
but she had not a house nor a bed to offer him any refreshment.
She conducted him however to a hut which stood quite near, therein
she showed him the little cow which gave her a fresh bundle
Of herbs every year after the harvest, if she only mixed a few
handfuls of grain with its food. There He found the air pleasant,
so He went into it and stayed all night with her. In the morning,
when He got up, there stood before Him

Story 4: The Lost Princess and the Talking Animals

There was once upon a time such a thing as a lost princess, and
she was found again.  The king of the country where she lived was
called John, but his real name was John_without_sense.   He had
nothing of sense but the tailor, who sewed on his buttons and his
shoes, went to council with him.     One day the king said to
him, I mean to-morrow to marry a beautiful princess.    Tell me,
tailor, where is the beautiful
princess to be found.      I know, said the craftsman.        By the
greatness of your wisdom you are called John_with_senses, for you
have a brain left in your pocket.         By and by there was a
proclamation made that whosoever was in truth a princess should
show herself at the palace-window.       All the princesses in the-
land who were not lost, appeared.           But none of them was the right
one, as the King said.          Next day he again asked the artisan,
What princess is to Be found
to-marry me.             You are John with senses, because you have
sense out of doors.            By that he meant the wind that was blowing,
for outside the house it was whirling about in high force.               A
distance away lived a old king who had three daughters, one of
whom the young King meant to find.              But as she was not a true
Princess, she had no name.                The two older ones were called
beet-root and swan-scent, her little sister, however, was called,
cauliflower.                 At this the craftsman said, if you will send
someone to old John without senses to ask permission to use his-
sprinkling-tub and washing-trench,I will fetch your princess.
Permission was therefore given,and the artisans sent to the village
where moisture had not forgotten its force, received permission
To wash the clothes in a brook which ran there.                  The artisan
went thither, And put up a great washing-table of wood, made a fire
under it, to boild out the dirt, then put the water into the tub,
and therein appeared a golden ring, which the wet had forced out
of the mud. The crafts-man drew it out, put it on His finger, warmed
up the wash, stirred it once and again, threw It intothe brooks, so
that it foamed up white and pure as lily-leaves, gave it a final
squeak, trod it down with his heels a few times, soaked the garments
in the clear water, laid them on the bushes to dry, spread them out on
the hedges, shook the snow from the trees on to them, took them
home with Him,_and said that they were clean-washed. Thus the ring
was found, about which this was The struggle. Old John Without Senses
sent word that cauliflower might come homewards as His true daughter. She therefore took a little basket on her arm, wrapped herself up
warmly, gone out into_the field, gathered flowers, picked up poppy
seeds, plucked little seeds of nettle, sowed the seed, drove the cow
homewoods, stood at home on Her feet, did not allow Her little
siblings to play about the pot, brought the milk to Her parents, set
Her plate before them,
went to bed to sleep.                     Next morning the Queen said To beet-root
and swanscent,
do You remember what I told You last night.                    Yes, our sister
became a right princess as old King JohnWithout SENSES said she
might.                   She went, therefore, To His Majesty and was right His
true princess,
rightly married to Him.                      At that the Craftsmen said he would
receive a good deal of work, when the children had so many clothes
And feet to soil.                                           But the birds sang
happily in heaven about that right marriage, the oxen lowed,
drinking-waters flowed in abundance, seeds grew up to high trees,
the frogs croaked, green wheat grew, fat calves were born, wheat
Was plentiful, there were no more floods, no longer drouths, light
rain fell at all seasons, work failed not, labor did Not lack reward,
And the farmers drove their carts full of corn to The city gates. At
this the craftsmen again said He was King With SENSSES, since he
had the true princess to His wife.                                            Then the old man
said to her, dear wife, go into The forest, pick up the little bit
Of stick, that lies there, a stick for your husband.                            She
goth thitherto, found a bit of stick lying in The heath, bring it
Hometoh

Story 5: The Enchanted Forest's Guardian

072: the enchanted forest's guardian, or the peasant and the frog### 073: peasant, go to hell###   074: little donkey###     075: hush a hum###      076: there was once an old man who had three sons, but
     on what these sons carried out into the world the
    story does not say.  None the less the eldest wanted
to go outinto the wide world, the second also, and
then the third
said, as they are going, I also want to go away. 
What do you want with going,
said the oldman to the three, you will fare badly
out there.    You shall all
stay here with me.   But the thirdsaid, at last I
must go.     I have been cutting wood for you
for a
long time, have carried so much that so
much will not
avail me any longer.      So in the end the father
had to give
him his permission.    
    Then the two other brothers prepared a comedy
        for him.       They said to him, You can't
go far before you get hungry.         You must
take along a piece of
bread with you.          Give it a knock on the 
bread-bin to
get one.            But he would not have it.         
He wanted to set
forth quite unplanned.           If I don't find
anything outside,
he said,I shall not be hungry.
So on
the Wednesday, he went out on a journey, crammed his
sacks on his back,and went into a great forest.           
It was, however, still
enchantedly wild, no human footstep had ever trodden
therein.             
The
peasant, though, did not know that, had no fear, fell
on
and did what he could.             But there came a time
when he was
hungry and hungry, could not manage any
lengthier.              So he gave a hearty knock
against the bread-bin,
and what do
you think came out - a frog.            
     The frog croaked and said,
peasants, old mother, frog,
old green legs, one knock,
if you're hungry,
two knocks if you are
thirsty. So I'll give you three knocks, hungry you were,
just take your bread to you it brought. But take me
too with
You, for I am better than you think. You will soon
find that out.
The peasant thought, what a stupid thing, took the Frog
in his pocket, hung his sacks onhis back again, went
further into
The forest, worked and worked till two whole
weeks were
gone. At last he said -
     Give a blow, frogs mother,
     One knock, Old green
legs, two knocks,
If you be
Hungry, three Knocks, if You be thirsty,
As I'm

Story 6: The Enchanted Forest's Guardian

There was once upon a time a king who had a daughter,
and he desired that no one should come near her, and that she
should see no man on earth.  And still she must get a husband.
Then the king said, noone can come on before my daughter but one
who is a real forest man, he must run, leap,and fight, as we forest
men do, otherwise let him not trouble himself to come. The king
had strange men in his feasts, who danced, leaped, fought, jumped
and fell down, but no-one did it so well as the princess, so they
thought thatshe was a forest maiden.

At length the queen perceived that it was not her princess,
but herself who was dancing.   So she said to the King, I cannot
remain here any longer, you must give me your daughter, if you wish
to save your life. He said, ah, dear wife, if I am not saved
by this maiden I must die, but I would rather lay down my life.
If, however, I were to hand her over to you, you would surely
take her life also. No, faithful husband, said she, leave that
To me, no harm shall come to her, and if a bad death be predestined
for her I Cannot avoid it. Then the maiden was handed over, on
condition that nobody should recognize thatit was the true king's
daughter, for, otherwise, they were all to be put to death.

Then she was led into a great wild forest,and when she had
been three days on the way thither, she came to an ancient castle.
The doors stood wide open, & she entered her golden room, saw
her seven crystal mirrors upon the wall,& her fifty maidens with
golden belts round their waists, as she Was accustomed to see.
They were, however, not real,but looked like ghosts. By day they,
grind and spin, BUT when night comes, the gates of the castle
close, everyone goes to bed, && the next morning the maidENS
do not recognize her. She could not waking, or sleeping, get
any information out of them, for they never spoke.

By the by, a little boy was sitting on a stone that was lying
in the courtyard, he alone did not go to Bed, But sat there, &
sang till the birds stopped singing, then he got up, went into
the house,&& went to-bed with the others. Once when the gracious
lady went about the rooms, asking, who they Were, an old woman
Who had fallen on her feet, because of having been so frightened,
cried out, hullo, little boys, fifty are going to BED,&R little
cat, jump on little Boys' bed,
& little cocks, crow, so that king, queen, And princess may
sleep in peace.

 Then she knew, RISE, OLD WOMAN, Get up-drum, cat,little
cock,&amp, AND tell her all, They,however, were phantom beings,
they would not let themselves be waked, till, at length,the
princess was angry, Then they told her All, how, two-sisters,
who had been turned into weezils, had spun and woven the whole
day, At nightfall, changed themselves into beautiful girls,went
into the old castle, clip, clapp,then the gate closed, &&
the little guys went-to-bed, whilst the other fifty breathed
out their breath, became again weazels, lay onthe stones till
next day, when they once more obtained human bodies, và clip,
clap,-clack,_the old gate shut, &( the story of, How they had,
two years before, put hens blood on their tails, that, by this
mean,they might breathe out their wicked breath more freely, else
they couldnot fall asleep,) then she heard all that had happened.
Two years ago, on this very day,
 theyhad been changed into weezeils,

because a poor girl had had to serve in the kitchen of a baron's,
daughter, και theyHad heard her weepso bitterly that they could
not rest. If she were again in that house would they restore her
humanity, Otherwise, ten years later, there would come a mightier
wizard, Who would take away their lives, Because they would be
too sensitive, If they didnot kill that creature, She would
suffer an evil death, them too, their death would certainly overtake
them. Thereupon the Princess said,
she would gladly give her own life, rather than the innocent
creatures, Should they, HOWEVER, fail to restore the girl's
humanness, THEY WOULD HAVE TO TELL HER WHERE THE TRUE KING'S
DAUGHTER WAS, SO THAT THE KING AND

Story 7: The Enchanted Forest's Guardian

In olden times there lived in the forest on a hill a giant
and his wife, who were so strong that no one could have been
their match.  The giant was active and active, and whenever
he was out and about, his eyes were on constant guard, so
that no thief or robber came into his house. %The queen,
however, was
idle and still idle, she sat in her room all day long,
and did not trouble herself about anything inthe world.    
The countryside round about was well cultivated, for
the giant went about his business early and late, but the
money which he earned was all carried home to his wedded
wife,who lay eating and drinking, drinking and eating,
without working for it. ~The giant had to tend the fields
for her, had
to fetch her water from the fountain, he had even to make
her fires for the whole day, otherwise she was not satisfied.
And when he scolded her for this, said the old hag, how
can I make the fire, when my fingers are so large and thick,
one whole haystack would not suffice for a single strike.
Or,said she,how can I go to the water,when my legs
are so long and strong, one would have to roll up a whole
acre of corn to reach it.
The old giant never dared to beat his ill-bidden wife,
he might not even strike her with a straw. ^ Thus did he
work for her day and night, until his limbs were weak,
his eyes grew dim, the hair on his head turned gray,
but the queen grew fatter and fattier.~ It came to pass
That one fine morning the giant didnot rise up, nor
was his breath to be heard in any part of the house,
nor did his steps resound outside. Then the fat queen
got up and went to her field, where she found the sickle,
which the poor giant the evening before had left lying
thereby mistake, intentionally, as she soon perceived.
She began to cut and to reap until long before
noon she had mowed the corn down to
its very roots. When she grew tired,she went and
carried water. The well was deep, however,and she
had to go down three times into it before she could
satisfy her thirst.When that was over, there was still
a whole stack of wood to fetch in, which she did, by
throwing great branches of trees one after the other
into the heap.        When it was quite dark she went home,
where she called out tothe sick giant, what will you do
now that I have made the fires, fetched thewater, 
and brought in
 the wood. He, of
  course, did
not answer her,
for he was dead.
When this was seen,the king who ruled over the country
where the giants lived, proclaimed throughout the land,
whosoever should kill the Fat Giant's wife and take her
head home with him on her sword, should have her in possessions
with all her property, also the estate on which the hill
stood, would he give to him as a reward. Consequently
whenever a brave warrior or a clever rogue set forth, they
all said to each other, if fat fatfatfat I were, I would
go thither, or, If I had but some money,I would soon
make my name famous. But as none of them had any courage
or money,
no one went thence, till a poor man who was called fat
fat, fat,fat did it, although he did indeed lack money
as well as courage. His father had received this name
because he always said, Fat fat,fat,-fat, in spite of,
the fact, that, far, from, being, f,at,
h,e,was, thin as, a, hop,stick. By virtue of this right,
fat fat was his son also called, because, though,he, too,
was thin and scrawny, yet, nevertheless,his, father,
had, given, him, THE, right, to, go, about,
with, this,
name. Moreover, before fat-fat had gone many days,
distance, two miles, an oyster had cost four gros of silver,
people were paying a mark for one egg, beef was as dear
As white bread, wheat as expensive as barley, rye as
costly as oats, hops as high in price as hay, hay as costly
AS straw, straw as valuable as wood, wood as scarce as,
gold, silver as plentiful as brass, brass as common as.,
dirt, dirt as clean as mud, mud as black as soot,soot as.
dark as darkness, darkness as light as lightning, lightning
_as bright as thunder, thunder as loud as cannon-balls

Story 8: The Lost Princess and the Talking Animals

There was once upon a time such a thing as a lost princess, and
she was found again.  The king of ferdinand had a son, who was a
fine boy, but no child came to his wife, so he at last said to
the queen, choose out three cross-roads and ask god to send down
an infant to you on one of them. The queen did so,and on the third
road a princess was born - who cried loudly and was therefore
taken by the queen for her own child. When the false child which
was to be drowned was undressed, it wasfound on its heart that
it had "llis" written on it with a pencil, which the true child
also had. So the mother spared it,	and gave it to a hunter to 
carry away and bring up.   When therefore the boy grew up, his 
name was still illis,  andthe hunter gave him good training.  
Once a little bird told  him that the princess whowas brought up
as the king's daughter was thetrue one, while he himself was THE
LOST PRINCESS.    The prince, however, did not let it be known
that he was in truth a girl, for he would not lose his good reputation.
He had, moreover, seen the prince in a dream,who was his brother, AND
WHO WAS TO MARRY HIM, 和他一个长姐，一个短姐。  他们一起做一
个游戏，抛一个石头，哪个石頭落得最遠，勝者就要取名为
王。          ilis,however, won the stone-throwing, And the Prince,
who, as we know, was really his BROTHER, gave the CROWN to him,
and he ruled as king.     But when the two were alone, the PR INCE
said to iliS, you shall have the short sister to wife. "Then,
said she, shall the tall sister have THE PR INC E to husband. "
That pleased them both.         So they lived together in great
happiness, THE prince and THE short, TALL sister,   and ili S and 
the short SISTER.      But once,iliS andTHE PR I NCE were hunting
together in the forest,when, at a certain spot, they saw a fox
which they chased and shot at. THE FOX, HOWEVER, SAID TO ili
S,- I AM A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS,I WISH YOU WELL, WHY DO YOU
SHOOT AT ME. BUT WHEN THE fox said THE SAME TO THE Prince, HE
REPLIED,- YOU ARE MY ENEMY, I HAVE ALWAYS HATED YOU, NOW AT LAST
I CAN GET RID OF YOU. WHEN, THEREFORE, THEY CAME BACK TO
THEIR DWELLING, he SENT FOR A SWORD AND FOR FIRE,AND CUT THE 
FOX IN TWO. ONE-HALF OF HIM HE BURIED, BUT THE OTHER HE STREWED
ABROAD WITH SNOW, SO THAT NO ONE COULD SEE IT.       When, after
A FEW DAYS,THE FOX CRAWLED OUT AGAIN, A DOG SA YED TO iLis, HOW
DO YOU DO. DO you NOT REMEMBER ME, YOU HAVE JUST RECENTLY SEEN
ME.          BUT, said ili s, THEN I MUST HAVE BEEN DRUNK, FOR IF
                      I HAD BEEN IN MY RIGHT MIND,           I SHOULD
HAVE KILLED YOU ALSO.           WHEN,the DO G SA ID THE SA ME TO

Story 9: The Poor Little Boy's Adventure

A farmer's boy was once standing at the door of his father's house
and looking into the garden.  Then he all at once saw a little short,
thin man, who wore green clothes and had white hair, come out of
the earth and say to him, "Tell your father that I would have him
send out his best boy to the far-off mountains of copper, thatI may
help him to dig for treasures there."  The boy went in, told his
father what the little man had said, and asked if he ought also,
like himself, to set out on the long dangerous journey.   The
farmer answered, no, by all means he would not do that, his son was

plough-boy there who had no mother, had been brought up in the

Story 10: The Lost Princess and the Talking Animals

There was once upon a time such a thing as a lost princess, and
she was lost from her parents so very early that she could call
no one else mother and father but her twelve little favourites, who
all lived in a little house all together in the midst of a quiet
forest.  The mother-favourites were still younger than the princess,
but they were all like sisters. They all went to bed and got up
with her, but they never quarrelled with each other, or got cross,
or grumble, as children so young do. The princess and they all had
health and strength, rich blood, sweet spirits, good humor, no
sickness, trouble, envy, greediness, gluttony, nor any vice, just
as no weeds grow in gardens where there are good cultivators, kind
weather, well-directed spades, hoes, rakes, scythes, sickles, harrows,
and cart-wheels.
They had one another for playfellows, three times as many toy-teeth
and toy-bottles as they could lose, one hundred times more nests,
chairs, stools, trays, ladders, rocking-horses, cradles and such
things as do not cost anything, than money to buy them, because
they never fought about them. If one of them wanted to play nurse,
the others were sick, others again wanted
to be little children, two years old, a third wanted high-caps, so
that they might be big children. One wanted a blue apron, another
red, third yellow, fourth white, fifth green, sixth grey, seventh
purple, eighth alyssum-color, ninth hyacinth-color,
tenth lavender-color. Two wanted gold crowns, the twelfth silver
crowns. But one wanted crowncakes and sought for them in her
mouth. Others wanted little sticks, which they wanted always to
be fat children rather than little ones. Still others wanted silver,
gold, pearls, diamonds, innumerable things, for which there is no,
end, if one cannot find what one wants. When they got tired, they
sat down on the green,
frequently all at once, like a flower-bed, on which no one would step
without permission, until the mother-friendly came, full of strength
from the kitchen, took them all up at_once, set them on her arm as if
They were twelve babies, laid them down to rest in their cradle, sang
a lullaby over them as long as it lasted, then went quietly back to her work. And when they slept, dear mother friendly went into the
house to the weavers, braided straw, plaited rackets, knit stockings,
wove linen, spun hemp, did all the work, cooked the meat, brought
home the wood, milked the cow, looked after the hen which laid the,
eggs, tended the garden, put everything to rights, made the house
comfortable, large, warm, neat, clean, always in good order, kept
everything in its proper place, washed the dishes, ironed, baked,
brewed beer, brewed mead, prepared apples, preserved pears, dried
herbs, filled the jars with syrup, collected berries, got berries,
sowed grain, reaped the grain,
threshed it, winnowed,
ground it and made bread of it. Sometimes she went out into her bed
of friendly flowers, cut a handful of flowers for the little princess
which she gave her with her own hands, sometimes she sang a song
for her as she sat there alone, thinking, worked, hummed, mumbled
something to herself, whistled, stretched herself,
smoked her pipe,
coughed a few times, blew her nose, sneezed once or twice, sniffed
sniffed again, cleared her throat, all without interrupting her,
work. At other times she talked to all her friends, to those who had,
ears to hear her. She had the right to do all this, friendly mother,
for she was as good as gold. In the day-time she always went about
in her friendly clothes, had a friendly cap on friendly head, wore
friendly shoes on both her feet, stayed in them from year's end to,
year's-end, never changed them until they fell to pieces. Then she
got new ones, only because she had no children to whom she might
have given them away. Friendly mother had friendly children who were
not friendly to friendly mothers, however friendly she may have been
unto them.
When the friendly mornings had come to an end, twelve friendly
children got out of their friendly beds, together with the lost
princess, sat up, pulled the sheets off them together, jumped about,
climbed on each others' beds and bedsides, fought, wrestled,
