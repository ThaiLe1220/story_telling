Once upon a time, in a humble village nestled between rolling hills and a deep, dark forest, there lived a poor widow named Greta and her only daughter, Anna. They were kind-hearted but had little to eat, often sharing their meager meals with neighbors who were even worse off.

One chilly evening, as the wind howled and the snow began to fall, Anna ventured into the forest to gather firewood. As she searched among the trees, she came upon an old woman dressed in tattered clothes, shivering beneath a bare oak.

"Dear child," the old woman whispered, "might you spare a crust of bread or a sip of water?"

Anna's heart ached with compassion. "I have nothing with me," she replied softly, "but please, come home with me. We have little, but what we have, we will gladly share."

The old woman smiled, and her eyes twinkled like stars. "You are kind, my dear. For your generosity, I shall give you a gift." She reached into her cloak and pulled out a simple iron pot. "This is no ordinary pot. Whenever you are hungry, say the words 'Boil, little pot, boil,' and it will fill with the most delicious soup. When you have had your fill, say 'Stop, little pot, stop,' and it will cease cooking."

Astonished and grateful, Anna thanked the old woman and hurried home. That night, she and her mother enjoyed a hearty meal, the likes of which they hadn't tasted in years. Word of their good fortune spread quickly, and they never turned away anyone in need, always willing to share their endless soup.

One day, while Anna was away gathering herbs, Greta decided to use the pot herself. She said the magic words, "Boil, little pot, boil," and indeed, it began to bubble with fragrant soup. However, when she had eaten her fill, she realized she did not know how to make it stop.

"Enough now, pot," she commanded. But the pot did not heed her words. "Cease cooking!" she cried, but still, the soup rose higher and higher, spilling over the rim.

Panicked, Greta tried to lid the pot, but the soup overflowed, pouring onto the floor, out the door, and into the streets. The villagers watched in amazement as rivers of soup flowed through the village, filling their bowls and pots.

When Anna returned, she saw the chaos and quickly shouted, "Stop, little pot, stop!" Immediately, the pot ceased boiling, and the torrent of soup subsided.

From that day on, the village never went hungry again. They learned to work together, sharing the magic pot wisely. Greta and Anna were celebrated for their kindness, and the old woman's gift became a blessing for all.

And so, the humble village thrived, warmed by the spirit of generosity and the endless bounty of the little magic pot.
