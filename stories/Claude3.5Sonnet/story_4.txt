In a small village nestled among the misty mountains, there lived a poor widow named Greta and her three hungry children. Every day, Greta worried about how she would feed her family, for their cupboards were often bare.

One bitter winter's night, as a fierce storm raged outside, there came a knock at their door. Greta opened it to find an old woman, her cloak covered in snow. "Please," the woman croaked, "might I warm myself by your fire?"

Though they had little to offer, Greta welcomed the stranger inside. She wrapped the old woman in a threadbare blanket and gave her the last crust of bread in the house.

As dawn broke and the storm subsided, the old woman rose to leave. "Kind Greta," she said, "your generosity has touched my heart. Take this pot as a gift." From beneath her cloak, she produced a small, blackened iron pot.

"This is no ordinary pot," the woman continued. "It will always provide soup for those in need, but beware - it must never be used for selfish gain." With those words, she vanished into the morning mist.

Greta, curious but skeptical, placed the pot on the fire. To her amazement, it began to bubble and steam, filling the air with a delicious aroma. When she lifted the lid, she found it brimming with hearty vegetable soup.

From that day forward, Greta and her children never went hungry. Word spread of the magic pot, and soon, villagers came from far and wide to share in its bounty. Greta, remembering the old woman's words, never turned anyone away.

As the seasons changed, the village prospered. Gardens flourished, and the townspeople, no longer worried about hunger, shared their abundance with neighboring villages.

But one day, a greedy merchant heard tales of the never-ending soup pot. He offered Greta a fortune for it, promising her a life of luxury. Greta, tempted by the thought of never working again, agreed to sell the pot.

The moment gold exchanged hands, the pot grew cold and cracked in two. From its broken halves sprang the old woman, her eyes flashing with disappointment. "Greta," she said, "you have forgotten the true magic of the pot - not its endless soup, but the kindness it inspired in others."

With a wave of her hand, the old woman disappeared, taking the broken pot with her. Greta wept, realizing too late the precious gift she had squandered.

But all was not lost. The villagers, remembering the generosity Greta had shown them, now came to her aid. They shared their food and helped her tend a bountiful garden. Though the magic pot was gone, its lesson remained: true wealth lies not in gold, but in the kindness we show to others.

And so, in that little village among the misty mountains, no one ever went hungry again, for they had learned that when everyone shares, there is always enough for all.
