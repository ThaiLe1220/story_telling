Once, in a kingdom far to the north, there lived a princess named Elara. She was as beautiful as the winter moon, with hair as pale as snow and eyes as bright as the northern lights. Yet, despite her grace and charm, Elara was forgotten, for she had been born during the darkest of winters, when a great curse had fallen upon her kingdom.

On the day of her birth, a mysterious sorceress appeared in the royal court. "Your daughter will grow in beauty and wisdom," the sorceress declared, "but when she reaches her sixteenth year, she shall be imprisoned in a tower of ice, and none shall remember her name."

The king and queen begged for mercy, but the sorceress only smiled and disappeared in a swirl of frost and snow. True to her word, as the years passed, the kingdom began to forget Elara. The servants did not speak of her, the people did not sing of her, and even her own parents seemed to forget they had a daughter. Only Elara herself remembered the truth, and as her sixteenth birthday approached, dread filled her heart.

On the day she turned sixteen, the skies darkened, and a bitter cold swept across the land. As the first snowflakes fell, Elara was spirited away to a great tower of ice in the heart of the frozen wilderness. The tower stood tall and glistening, its walls shimmering like glass. Inside, the rooms were cold and empty, and the only sound was the howling wind outside.

Time passed, but in the kingdom, no one remembered the princess. She became nothing more than a distant memory, like a dream that fades with the morning light. Alone in her icy prison, Elara wandered the endless halls, her footsteps echoing in the emptiness. She cried out for help, but no one came. The curse had hidden her from the world, and no one would ever search for her.

Years went by, and Elara’s heart grew cold as the ice around her. She began to forget her own name, her past, and her kingdom. The tower became her entire world, and the ice that surrounded her grew thicker, until it seemed that even her own soul was frozen.

But one winter’s night, when the northern lights danced in the sky, a young hunter named Lior ventured deep into the wilderness. He had heard tales of a cursed tower hidden in the frozen forest, and though none remembered the princess, legends still whispered of a treasure locked within. Driven by curiosity, Lior followed the shimmering lights until he found the tower.

Its gleaming walls rose before him, cold and foreboding, but Lior was not deterred. He climbed the slippery steps and reached the highest chamber, where Elara sat, her form as pale as the ice that surrounded her. Her once-bright eyes were dull, and her hair had turned white as frost.

"Who are you?" Lior asked, though he knew not if she would answer.

Elara’s lips parted, but no words came. She had forgotten even the sound of her own voice. Lior, seeing her sorrow, knelt beside her. Though she was as cold as stone, he reached for her hand, and as he did, something stirred within her—a warmth she had not felt in years.

"You are no treasure of gold or jewels," Lior said softly. "You are something far more precious."

At his words, the ice around the tower began to crack and melt. Elara’s memory slowly returned, piece by piece, and with it came the warmth of her heart. The tower shuddered and groaned, collapsing into a river of water that flowed through the frozen forest, carrying the curse away with it.

Lior and Elara stood together in the thawing snow, the cold and darkness lifted. And though the kingdom had long forgotten her name, Elara’s return brought new life to the land. With Lior by her side, the forgotten princess was no longer alone, and her tale of ice and sorrow melted into one of warmth and hope.
