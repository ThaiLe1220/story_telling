Once upon a time, in a small village at the edge of a dark, sprawling forest, there lived a shoemaker named Kaspar. Though he was poor, he was known far and wide for his cleverness and skill with his hands. Kaspar could mend the most tattered boots and create shoes that would last a lifetime. Yet despite his talent, fortune had never smiled upon him. His workshop was bare, and he often went without food.

One autumn evening, as Kaspar was returning from the market where he'd sold barely a pair of shoes, he sat by the forest’s edge, sighing heavily. Just as he closed his eyes to think, a voice as light as the wind whispered, "Why so glum, shoemaker? Isn't your craft enough to fill your purse?"

Startled, Kaspar looked around and saw no one. Then, from behind an ancient oak, a small figure emerged. It was no bigger than a child, with hair the color of autumn leaves and eyes that gleamed mischievously like moonlight on water. It was a forest spirit.

"You should know better than to speak to strangers in the woods," Kaspar replied cautiously, though his heart raced.

The spirit laughed, a sound like leaves rustling in a breeze. "Oh, I know you, clever Kaspar. And I can give you all the wealth and fortune you deserve."

Kaspar raised an eyebrow, knowing well the tales of spirits and their tricky bargains. "And what would you ask in return?"

The spirit twirled on its toes, scattering golden leaves at its feet. "Ah, just a little thing. You shall have gold and customers from far and wide, but in one year's time, you must guess my true name. If you fail, your hands—those hands that craft such fine shoes—will be mine, and you will never work again."

Kaspar’s eyes narrowed, but the thought of finally escaping poverty was tempting. After all, a year was a long time, and Kaspar trusted his cleverness. He agreed to the spirit's terms.

As soon as the deal was struck, gold coins appeared in his pockets, and the very next day, villagers crowded his shop, begging for shoes. News of Kaspar’s craftsmanship spread, and he soon became the wealthiest man in the village. His new wealth brought him comfort, but the spirit’s words weighed heavily on his mind.

Day and night, Kaspar searched for the spirit’s name. He asked travelers, read old books, and listened to the stories of elders, but no one could tell him what he needed to know. As the year drew to a close, worry gnawed at him.

On the eve of the final day, Kaspar, desperate and sleepless, ventured deep into the forest. He wandered aimlessly until he stumbled upon a clearing, where a fire burned brightly. Hidden in the shadows, he saw the forest spirit dancing around the flames, singing a song in its strange, high voice.

"Hopp and skip, and leap I go,
With Kaspar's hands I'll sew and sew!
For who but I, sly Rumpelrich,
Will make his clever fingers twitch!"

Kaspar's heart leapt. He had the name!

The next morning, as the sun rose, the spirit appeared in his workshop, grinning with anticipation. "Well, shoemaker, time is up. Do you know my name?"

Kaspar pretended to think for a moment, then said, "Could it be... Rumpelrich?"

The spirit’s smile vanished, and it let out a furious shriek. "Clever Kaspar! You've won this time!" And with that, the spirit vanished in a whirlwind of leaves.

From that day on, Kaspar lived in peace, his hands still his own, crafting shoes that were the envy of every cobbler in the land. And though his wealth grew, he never made a deal with a spirit again.
