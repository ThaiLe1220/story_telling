Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between two tall mountains, there lived a poor widow named Marta. She had little more than a small hut, a patch of land that yielded only weeds, and a single daughter named Liesel. Despite their hardships, Marta and Liesel were kind-hearted, always willing to share what little they had with those in need. But more often than not, their own stomachs went empty.

One evening, as the first snows of winter began to fall, Marta sat by the fire stirring a thin, watery broth in an old iron pot. Liesel sat beside her, shivering in their tattered blankets. As the firelight flickered across the room, there came a soft knock on the door.

Marta opened it to find an old woman standing in the cold. Her face was wrinkled like dried apples, and her clothes were little more than rags. Yet there was something in her eyes, something wise and ancient.

"Please, kind woman," the old stranger said, her voice trembling with age. "Might you spare a bit of soup for a weary traveler?"

Though Marta had hardly enough for herself and her daughter, her heart could not refuse. "It isn't much," she said, "but you are welcome to share what little we have."

The old woman smiled, stepping inside and warming her hands by the fire. Marta ladled out a small bowl of the thin soup, giving the stranger the best portion.

After the woman finished her meal, she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and said, "You have shown great kindness, even when you had so little to give. For that, I will give you a gift."

From her tattered cloak, the old woman pulled out a small pouch. She sprinkled a handful of shimmering dust into the iron pot and muttered a few words under her breath. The pot began to bubble, filling the room with the rich scent of herbs and meat.

"This pot," the old woman said, "shall never run empty. No matter how much you take, it will always provide enough to feed you and anyone who comes to your door. Use it wisely, for it is a gift of great power."

With that, the old woman vanished into the night, leaving Marta and Liesel staring in wonder at the bubbling pot. Cautiously, Marta ladled out more soup, and to her astonishment, the pot remained full. She scooped out another bowl, and another, yet the pot stayed brimming with hearty stew.

Word of the magic soup pot quickly spread through the village, and soon, everyone—rich and poor—came to Marta’s door. She fed them all without question, and the pot continued to give, no matter how many mouths were fed. No one in the village went hungry that winter, thanks to the widow’s generosity.

But not everyone was content with this newfound abundance. The village mayor, a greedy and jealous man, could not stand the thought of a poor widow having something so valuable. One night, he devised a plan to steal the pot for himself.

Disguised as a beggar, the mayor came to Marta's door. "Please, good woman," he said, hiding his face under a hood, "might I have just a small bowl of your magic soup?"

Marta, as always, welcomed the beggar in and filled a bowl for him. As soon as her back was turned, the mayor grabbed the pot and ran out into the night, believing he could keep the endless food for himself.

But when the mayor returned to his grand house and placed the pot on the fire, something strange happened. The pot did not fill with soup, but instead with thick, dark mud. Furious, he tried again and again, but no matter how much he stirred, the pot produced nothing but foul sludge. In his rage, the mayor smashed the pot against the wall, shattering it into pieces.

The next morning, Marta discovered her pot had been stolen, but she did not weep or despair. She and Liesel returned to their simple lives, thankful for the time they had been able to help their neighbors.

As for the mayor, his house soon fell into ruin, and he was forced to beg for food just as he once had tried to steal it. The villagers, who remembered Marta’s kindness, would not turn him away, though no one ever trusted him again.

And though the magic soup pot was gone, the village had learned a valuable lesson: that true wealth lies not in endless abundance, but in the generosity of a kind heart.
