Sagacious the Bear. Once upon a time there was a woodsman, and he had three sons whom he loved as dearly as his own soul; so when they went out to work in the forest, their mother used not to let them go without first giving each of them a slice of bread with butter on it for fear lest they might lose themselves or meet with any adventure that would make them hungry. One day these boys were sent into the great dark pine-wood to fetch some fir-timber home. They brought back a cart-load, but then said to one another: 'We can take no more at present.' So they agreed to leave what was left behind by itself till morning, and set off homewards. Then they heard a deep voice saying from among the trees, which made them stop and look round. A large black bear stood before them. The eldest thought nothing could save him now but to run away, and ran all he knew how, and did not turn again until he reached home. When he told his mother what had happened she gave her second son a piece of bread, took an axe herself, and accompanied the two younger ones to bring up the rest of the timber. But scarcely had they got half-way through the forest than the same voice called aloud, whereupon the boy's heart grew faint within him, and full of terror he fled for dear life and never stopped running even after he had arrived safely at home. His mother comforted him, put food into his hands, fetched a hatchet, took the youngest brother along with her, and started once more, resolved this time to help the middle boy get his load of firs. As soon as they entered the forest again, they saw the bear walking towards them, which filled both hearts with alarm. Then came a loud peal of thunder, and behold instead of a hideous wild beast, there rose up out of the thicket a tall man whose head grazed against the treetops above them, and who grasped the huge boughs of oak and ash between his arms like twigs and reeds. He asked if they wanted firewood cut down, and offered to fell everything they pointed to for a measure of salt. The woman hesitated long whether to trust herself alone to such a giant, especially since they had already enough logs, however the good-natured fellow promised only to chop those branches which hung too low over the path, and to break off the tops of such as stretched high overhead, so that people should have room to walk under them comfortably, and then begged permission to begin. To show himself worthy of confidence, he worked hard for hours together without stopping or resting, while meanwhile the little wife kept sitting close beside him chatting merrily, and cutting chips to weigh in case anything disagreeable occurred. At length he struck one blow, which split a tree quite across from top to root, and bent its upper part earthwards whilst its lower portion remained standing straight upright in the air. On this the woman began to hurry off, but the mighty arm snatched her back gently, and pointing to the trunk exclaimed, 'Look here, you see your measure.' She hastened to fill her basket with splinters, and found exactly four measures' weight. Forthwith the man helped his mistress out of doors, laid the log flat beneath the ground, and covered it thickly over with moss and turf, so cleverly indeed that every trace of it vanished utterly, and the spot became known as Himmelsberg Hill. In shorty after he disappeared likewise, and has been seen or spoken of ever since but few know whither he betook himself.
